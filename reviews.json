Well worth the visit with fantastic views, there was snow flurries but overall the scenery was superb.", "Fantastic experience. Great customer service by all staff. Very clean and tidy. Facilities were excellent, catered for everyone's needs including people with disabilities.", "Picture postcard views.  Spent two hours and never got bored. We ate at the buffet and it was delicious. So glad we did it. Highly recommend!", "Great “E-Ticket” ride to the top of Sulphur Mountain.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Views were spectacular from the peak with an additional walking path to the old weather station.", "An absolute must-do if you’re in the Banff area. It’s easy to get to using one of the local Roam shuttle buses. The check-in is well organized, and the line moves quickly. It’s a quick but fun ride to the top. The vistas are spectacular. Bring an extra layer of clothing though. The temps at 8 thousand feet can be brisk!", "We booked tickets in advance via TripAdvisor to avoid disappointment. On arrival, a friendly member of staff directed us to the booth to exchange our voucher. We joined the queue for the gondola. The staff were very efficient, and we did not wait long before we began our experience climbing up Sulphur Mountain. On arrival at the top, we took in the views before climbing to the top floor of the building, which allowed us even greater views of the surrounding mountains and the town of Banff. We spent about an hour relaxing and taking in the vista before descending in the gondola. Again the staff were very friendly and thanked us for our visit. One of the must do things when in Banff.", "Kinda expensive but I thought it was worth it.  We had a beautiful clear day so the views were amazing!!  We spent about an hour and a half up there enjoying the sights.  Saw a couple of mountain goat grazing.  We really enjoyed it.  We went around 10:00 in the morning.  When we came back down, about 5 or 6 bus loads arrived so I’m glad we got ahead of the rush!!!  Bought our tickets online.", "The lady checking our tickets was very nasty. We had booked tickets online and checked with her if they were okay and could just join the line, she said yes and after standing in the long line she asked us to exit the line when it was our turn saying we needed printouts of the ticket", "I had my old parents along and her behaviour towards us was very bad. We noticed that she told other passengers to get the print out before standing in the line but made us stand in the long line and then made us leave", "On the other hand, the people loading the gondolas were wonderful and so kind! We loved how they connected with us and wished us a good trip!", "The management needs to train such ignorant staff better", "Definitely a must see if visiting Banff National Park.  Just a bus ride up to the Goldola base then its an 8 minute ride up by gondola and just magical if snowing. There's a cafe, restaurant,  viewing platforms and you can walk up to Sulphur Mountain if you want to. It was snowing so a bit icy to walk.", "The walkway and view are breathtaking and dinner in the restaurant at sunset was unforgettable.

The views were great when we could see, the day we were there was impacted by the weather.  So, for 16 minutes of rides and access to a gift shop, pricey food/coffee and a movie about Banff and a bit of museum, $80.  The free marshmallow and pink lemonade was nice, but $80 nice?  My friend is returning to Banff in June with his father and said that he was taking the gondola off his list for things to do.  If you have better weather, I’m sure you would explore more, but if you are with a family, the price I think would not commensurate with the value you get.  You’ll enjoy yourself, I just wonder how much?", "On the day we planned to ride the Gondola to the top of Sulphur Mountain the weather wasn't great. It had snowed a lot the night before and was still snowing. You could hardly see the mountains from town. However, it was our last day in Banff and we didn't want to miss this opportunity.", "We purchased our tickets at the gate and were impressed when the sales agent provided us with a warning of the less than ideal conditions and a live webcam view prior to paying for our tickets. We took sometime to talk it over and decided since we didn't have a benchmark experience to compare it to, we really wouldn't know any different and gave it shot anyway.  I am so glad we did!", "Despite visibility not being what it could be, we were  blown away by the views. It was truly an incredible experience. We took the boardwalk all the way to the weather station at the top. You could feel the air start to get thin and not going to lie, I was starting to get a little lightheaded, but I was determined to see the top.", "Given the weather conditions it was icy, luckily we had our crampons (ice pics) with us for our shoes which allowed us to be a lot more sure footed.", "The ride up and down in the Gondola were a thrill on their own.  This excursion is a little pricey but worth every penny!! I hope to have the chance to do it again someday.", "This was probably one of the best experiences I’ve had in a very long time.", "I initially thought that the admission fee was just to go up and down on the gondola, but I was pleasantly surprised to see it gave much more than that.", "When we reached the top of the mountain, there was a whole other area there with restaurants, coffee shops, and an opportunity to walk higher up on the mountain, which allowed us to get some stunning views.", "I thoroughly enjoyed the time here, we had a reasonable priced buffet dinner, with a great selection of food and drink, then browsed the gift shop, learned a bit more about the surrounding history, before descending with the gondola.", "Overall an amazing experience", "The view was amazing and we took so many photos which came out to be so good. The person Gandi was really helpful to us and he gave us a lot of information which was very helpful for our tour of gandola.", "I was challenged to do this, despite my intense fear of heights. It was a safe and comfortable ride up and down, and the sights were incredible. The exhibits were the cherry on top! Would highly recommend.", "Advice for folks like me - always sit facing the top of the mountain so you don’t have to look down.", "Amazing place. The gondola was amazing and offered good views, and when you arrived, the views were better. The boardwalk was a pretty long walk but it was worth it.", "A must see if you visit Banff.  Clean and efficient gondola provides scenic views over glorious Banff with views in every direction.   Outstanding views from walking area atop the gondola station.", "Well organized and appears to be fairly new. We took the gondola up and had lunch at the buffet. Hike up to the top of the hill was about 1 I’m and enjoyable. Might be nice for them to consider shoveling the snow, as it was pretty slippery.", "Amazing views! Buying the tickets on tripadvisor was worth it! There was no wait time. The only thing is the nightrise experience was missed. However the hike and food was perfect!", "Tickets say 7 Pm.

The falls were spectacular and that says a lot as we were still amazed at the end of a 3 week sightseeing trip in USA and Canada . A pity there was no option to tip by card . We never used cash at any stage of our travels and Salvatore really deserved a good tip .", "We had Tracey as a guide, she was very professional and a very knowledgeable and helped us with organising our day. Thoroughly enjoyed the day and would recommend it in future.", "We had a fantastic trip to Niagara Falls yesterday. Our guide and driver Suresh was very friendly and knowledgeable and looked after us well all day. We did the Hornblower boat trip and journey behind the falls and got soaked despite the ponchos but wouldn’t have missed it.", "From the very start of our tour to the end, Paul couldn’t have been more friendly, helpful, informative, entertaining and accommodating.", "We all thoroughly enjoyed our day, it was great to be taken to all the areas around Niagara Falls as well as the ‘main attraction’.", "We would definitely recommend booking with Queen tours, everything was planned and carried out perfectly.  It was so good to have a minibus with a limited number of people, it made the whole trip feel more personalised.", "Many thanks to Paul for making our trip so memorable.", "The experience has been incredible! The Niagara Falls are really worth to be seen...we did both the boat trip and the journey under the falls and they were both really nice. Paul our guide has been amazing with us! On time, very clear on the explanation of when and where to meet, funny, always smiling and helpful and patient also with people that didn't speak much English.", "An experience I Absolutely recommend.", "Suresh was so welcoming from the word go. He so wanted everyone to have the best day ever at Niagara Falls, and he didn’t fail! We stopped at the Niagara Clock, the maple leaf shop where we got to taste 3 different maple syrups, and some gorgeous chocolates made on site. Then we saw the Niagara whirlpool. It was such a lovely build up to the main event! Then on to Niagara. We paid for the boat trip, and I gave to say it was one of the most amazing things I have done, the boat goes as close as it can to the water falls, it’s a great experience. Then a couple of hours to spend in Niagara town.", "I would recommend this day trip without hesitation.", "The excursion was amazing, our guide was perfect ! He took care of us the entire day and helped with every question we had. He facilitated every step of the way and shared loads of interesting and endearing facts about the hallmarks we passed. He even gave us refreshments and treats all day. The minibus was perfectly clean too! Really perfect from top to bottom. And the Falls ! The Falls were a wonderful experience, a once in a lifetime event. I really recommend going on the boat it's truly a unique feeling of communion with Niagara Falls.

Pickup right outside our hotel was super convenient, the maple syrup tasting was fun & tasty, and the Falls were beautiful. We did not do the boat option (chilly weather & cold water made us decide to skip it), and still had a blast! Only wish we had more time to check out the power museum & cherry blossom trees at the falls. Traffic back into the city was pretty bad, but that’s out of their control. Otherwise it was a great trip! Tracy was a great guide and very friendly throughout the trip.", "Fantastic trip to the falls with Tracy our guide. Great value with added bonus of a stop off to sample maple syrup and chocolate!!. Trip itself was perfect balance of timings between the falls and seeing the area itself.", "Due to winter weather boat tours were not running however the journey behind the falls is certainly worthwhile and gets you very close", "Fabulous Niagara Falls Day trip from Toronto.

I did not get to sit next to my friend on the way to Niagara because the bus was so small and packed, and that was distressing for such a long journey. We ended up being on the bus a good 3 hours on the way out  there and being seated next to a stranger was not good. Being so low to the ground, when the tour guide tried to call our attention to sites on the way out, we could barely see anything except neighboring vehicles. The volume of the tour guide inside of the bus was also too loud. Our guide was friendly and knowledgeable at least.", "I didn't appreciate the 3 stops on the way out to Niagara. It could have been kept to one: the floral clock, which also had washrooms.", "The Journey Behind the Falls was definitely great, and I was not disappointed that the Maid of the Mist was not yet open on the Canada side. That being said, having 4 hours in the area was way too much. This also meant that we were driving back into Toronto during rush hour.", "Overall, this tour was way too long. I'd recommend renting a car, driving down super early before the rush hour sets in, doing Journey Behind the Falls and taking photos from the top, and driving back. It should be half a day. You don't need a 10 hour commitment to appreciate the beauty of the falls from the Toronto area.", "Fantastic tour of the falls. Tracey, our guide, was friendly and informative.

We were picked up exactly on time and taken from point to point with clear instructions on what we were seeing and where we would meet up.  Winston, our guide, was  courteous and informative.

I loved being picked up at my hotel.

I rebooked on the American side and was told no problem and it was more than the 24 hour cancellation time. Still waiting for my refund.", "Kevin our guide was great!  The low rating was due to the lack of communication from Trip Advisor.  The Niagara Falls boats were not running yet (beautiful sunny 70 day).  Instead of the boat, we went to an observation tower.  I expect to get a large refund from Trip Advisor-the behind the falls and observation tower to not come anywhere close to what we paid.  Trip Advisor failed us.", "Do not book with this company! They are a complete scam. They charged my family for a boat tour and behind the falls tour. We got to our hotel and I didn’t see any boats in the water. The day of the tour I called to confirm and was told that there were no boat tours running. I requested a refund and they directed me to another phone number. After lots of back and forth I was refused a refund. Almost $400 for an experience my entire family was looking forward to that literally did not exist.  Do NOT book this experience- they will steal your money!", "BEWARE SCAM ALERT!! Booked this online through Viator which is a third party that works with  local group tours in this case Canada walks. The advertisement only had a picture of a boat and promoted a boat tour - there was no visible print stating boat tours don't begin until May. They should not be allowed to falsely advertise a clear boat tour trip if they don't provide a boat trip as part of it. This is a bait and switch. We drove to the site expecting to get on a boat and they said it's a walking tour - $300 US for a walking tour which my kids can't even do? Are you serious. So we asked for a refund and they said no - and then called Viator and they said nothing they could do. So contacted credit card company and reported as fraudulent and false advertising and they will credit on their end and do an investigation. The two people who said they wouldn't give a refund were rude and actually said \"you should have read the fine print\" they both should be fired. Do not do business with these companies.", "Kevin, our tour guide, was exceptional. The welcome from the start and the interaction was excellent.

You will need to walk down a hill on pavement but is  not strenuous.  During the November timeframe the lines were not long but during spring and summer I have read you could be standing in line 1-2 hours to board the boat.  The boat ride is a bit rough but there are minimal seats avialable on the bottom level and if you choose to stand there are railings all along the boat.  We hurried to get on the bottom level to get a seat. Note: You will get wet. The tour provides a hooded rain slick but its very windy so it will not keep you dry.  I highly recommend to buy your tickets way in advance.  We booked all days were full.

We left the harbor and first stop was seals and sea lions for a few minutes. Next stop we saw bald eagles flying and one eating on the rocks with binoculars (and in free photos).

We got to see them popping just their head up, several full breaches, feeding and splashing, navigating/transiting, and they tossed a baby orca way up into the air.

I specifically booked this tour because it said it would be open, no ifs or maybes.  If it says it will be and then it changes,  we should have been notified and given a chance to cancel, which I would have.  We only found out the Hornblower portion had been canceled when one of the ppl in our tour group mentioned it, and at that point, it was too late to cancel.  Viator contacted me several times about other things but never about the boat portion being canceled.  Sad when keeping ppls money is more important than customer service.", "We had a wonderful time.

If you will go to their website it will say Morraine lake and Lake Louise tour and that’s what we booked. If we only knew we didn’t have to do this tour which cost us $300+ for our group.

We learned so many things about the cities and countryside we passed through. He made sure everyone was safe but also had fun. He gave us many recommendations of things to do and places to eat. It was the perfect amount of time to tour through each place.", "The tour itself was great, but they spend an hour picking up everybody at various hotels. The way it’s listed here as one meeting place would be a lot more efficient and leave more time at the fabulous Butchart Gardens. Frankly, I could have stayed there all day and skipped touristy Victoria, but the driver/narrator was excellent, the bus was comfy, and the ferry rides were also fun.

We could have done with a bit more time in Victoria, but appreciated that we needed to be on time for the ferry and the roads were busy. Well-worth the price of the trip.", "Excellent trip.

The gardens need at least three hours, we got 2 and a half hours on our tour.  The gardens are not like any gardens we have seen in the UK, where we visit 8 or 10 gardens each time we visit.  This is very much a carefully curated bedding garden on a very large scale.  Much planning of colour combinations and layout.  Requires a huge workforce to maintain. Not an herbacious border to be seen! Well worth a visit.", "Can you pickup and drop off two of us from 5470 Ash Ave, Vancouver, bc?", "I need help with a current booking.

Passengers on foot can board ferries directly, though, so it might technically be possible to hook up with the bus driver on board. It would be worth contacting the tour operator to check.", "Do we have to have a tour guide to enter the Butchart Gardens?", "No, in fact I didn’t see any. People wandered around on their own.

Easy to find at Canada place.", "The best $25 I’ve ever spent. If we ever return to Vancouver we will do it again. It’s exciting and similar to being on a roller coaster but there’s no danger.", "The actual ‘flying’ experience is quite a bit of fun, but it is so much shorter than they advertised it to be. They draw out the intro bit before you actually begin the flyover part, there’s also a short safety video which ends up only making the actual flyover part less than 9 minutes. For the amount that you pay, this should be seriously reconsidered.", "BEWARE. Poor value at over 100cad (including one senior discount) for two for 9 minutes of actual immersive experience The website and selling agents don’t tell you that most of the 25 mins of “the experience” is an introductory film of rather poor quality and the waits before and after.

Worth every minute.", "There seem to be a lot of hype about this attraction, which it sadly does not live up to. For a start its no where near 2 hours its 30 mins max, which includes safety video. Once we started our journey, i did get excited, however that soon dissipated, and i was left wondering, when it was going to get good. The cinematic view was patchy and you could see where the panels were which the film was projected on. You could also see the edge of the screen and then the black roof with equipment. Looking down at my feet i could also see the edge of the screen. This really spoilt the illusion and was hard to feel the magic of what it was set out to achieve. The film felt blurry in places and i wondered if they should re shoot it, and make the colours more vibrant. The example i have is like buying a tv with led and 4 k and really wishing you had bought a OLED 8k one. I have seen much better films at a superior quality at the IMAX. I think it would be great if it was also 3D, at least this would have given the thrills of what i believe they wanted to achieve, i dunno if i would recommend it or not, i suppose if its raining, its an in door thing to do. But i do have to say the only saving grace was that the staff were fantastic, super friendly and answered lots of my pre questions. They were smiley, happy people.", "Not impressed for the price. You pay by the half hour just to park.  You watch a short video before entering which in our opinion was silly and a waste of time. The flyover video is maybe 15 minutes long...  AI generated.   However the misty air, breeze and smells were pretty cool. I would not recommend wasting your time or money here.", "As noted in other reviews this is largely a waste of money. The real Flyover experience lasts only 8 minutes and the rest is filler.

Awful experience that could’ve been great.", "We really enjoyed the experiences and would thoroughly recommend. Well organised and lovely staff. I get motion sick but was ok mostly. It's definitely worth it for the 4 d experience. Awaken Canada had more variety of landscape than the Rockies but I am biased towards the Rockies experience having travelled there last year.", "As someone who’s experienced both Soarin’ at Disney World and FlyOver Canada in Vancouver, I can say without hesitation: FlyOver Canada is the superior ride in nearly every way.", "First off, the visuals are stunning. The crisp 4K projection of Canada’s diverse landscapes—from the towering Rockies to the misty beauty of Niagara Falls—feels richer and more immersive than Soarin’s CGI-heavy scenes. FlyOver makes you feel like you’re really there, flying just inches above the treetops, glaciers, and waves.", "Then there’s the immersion factor. FlyOver incorporates wind, scents, and mist with a level of precision that Soarin’ doesn’t quite match. You can smell the pine forests and feel the cool spray as you dive over waterfalls. The motion of the ride seats is smoother and better synced with the visuals, creating a seamless, exhilarating experience.", "And let’s talk about the storytelling. FlyOver Canada adds a local charm with its pre-show and narration, giving the whole ride an emotional arc that Soarin’ lacks. It celebrates the Canadian spirit, culture, and wild beauty in a way that feels authentic and heartfelt.", "Sure, Soarin’ gives you a whirlwind tour of world landmarks—but they feel a bit disconnected, and the transitions can be jarring. FlyOver’s journey feels cohesive and thoughtfully crafted, like a tribute to a country that’s every bit as vast and magical as it appears on screen.", "If you’re in Vancouver, FlyOver Canada is a must-do, and in my opinion, it’s not just better than Soarin’—it’s one of the best flying rides anywhere.", "This was great!!!", "We went with kids aged 10 and up.", "We saw both videos. It's kind of like a 10 minute imax video where your seat moves too.", "The Awaken Canada one was great - we recommend it!", "The Rockies was also really cool - but there were some parts that may scare a young child (like loud noises).", "Both rides start with the lights off in pitch blank for a few seconds - I would prepare kids who are really young.", "We went bc it was raining so this was a great indoor activity.", "We took the subway airtrain and it was a little hard to find after we got off but it was actually very close.

Professional driver and tour guide. Tour guide knew english french and Chinese. A walking tour with a local guide for old part of the town was arranged and was decent. However the civilization museum which apparently it's admission was included was a bit boaring. It was a great place for meet up and rest. What could improve this experience was a better communication with the Travellers in advance. Many details shated in the morning of the trip could be included in an email a couple of days in advance. I never received my confirmation from expedua and had to spend time to ensure the trip is confirmed.  The provided contact number for the tour was also functional partially.

Was loaded up on a bus with people who had paid to go to the ice hotel on the way. My choice, add $38 Canadian, or just wait in a tourist trap for 1 hour snd 20 mins while others went to Ice hotel. Opted to go in. Tour was bilingual, n English snd French. Guides third language was English (Chinese, then French) and he continued to use the f-word 3 times when speaking in English. Used properly “f communism”, but unnecessary/gratuitous. Glad my Mon wasn’t around. Bus broke down causing an hour + delay at the Falls. Very little time in Old Quebec. No accommodations/discounts offered.", "The pick up from hotel and the tour guide were vrry attentive and accomodating! Very informative and funny at the same time.

The guide and driver both did a great job. Such a magical experience!", "While Quebec City was beautiful, three hours of free time felt rather long on such a cold day.

The Copper & Art museum was also very interesting.  Yves was a great guide - friendly, knowledgeable and very humourous.", "It's billed as a trip to the falls but only 25% is spent there. Wasted time at a chocolate store could be eliminated. The trip to the basilica was good, it's an impressive church and if you are of the faith worth the time. The copper museum was interesting. Spend more time at the falls...its a natural wonder and you should have time to take the gondola up to the top. Would only recommend for people who want to check the box of seeing the falls or who physically can't do the walking", "Overall, the experience was pleasant! I was able to buy some stuff from the chocolate factory and the copper museum. The falls was indeed beautiful. The cathedral’s intricate architecture is awestruck!

We took a service bus from Downtown, which was easy to navigate, and purchased our tickets online, which again was simple to do.  The first thing we did was walk across the actual suspension bridge. The views were spectacular, and whilst very safe, the bridge does sway from side to side slightly, increasing when more people are on it. There are a number of trails you can follow with information plaques dotted around. We spent a couple of hours here and thoroughly enjoyed the visit.", "We were very happy to have a beautiful day t walk the bridge and the tree tops. It's more commercial than one would like but I understand that. The crowds were smaller seeing we started at 3:00 p.m. had a beer and a poutine afterwards by one of the fire pits. I would recommend especially with kids, it seems very fun and interesting for young children.", "Liam Clancey, Operations Manager gave us such a hard time with answering questions for the Tourism Challenge, and we weren’t given the questions that needed answering when we checked in.", "We were literally googling answers in front of him and asking other guests.

Was even better than expected!", "The suspension bridge park is a short drive from downtown Vancouver, or Stanley Park. There is a free shuttle bus if you don't have a car. There is paid parking across the street. We arrived about 9:30 and were glad we did so it wasn't crowded. The park was beautiful, even in the rain. We spent between 2 and 3 hours exploring.", "I have been here before but this time I bought my two sons who are aged 20 and 21.  They weren’t really impressed.  They said it was “ok”.  For the price, I don’t think it’s worth it.

Got a free shuttle bus from the harbour area, which runs every 30 minutes, to the park. Fabulous suspension bridge and walks high in the trees, and a “cliff” walk.

But it did include a free shuttle service from downtown Vancouver.... so we thought we'd try it.", "It begins with lots of informative panels about the history of the park.  Then it was time to take a deep breath and cross the bridge.  Not a fan of heights, I was a little worried about crossing the bridge.  It wobbles a bit here and there (after all it is a suspension bridge) but there is a lookout tower with a staff member watching everything ensuring there are no shenanigans on the bridge.  And if there was, a public address message was played on the bridge reminding everyone to behave.", "Note - the message was played when we were on the bridge because someone wanted to take a photo of their garden gnome in the middle of the bridge.", "Despite all these safety precautions, I still moved slowly along the bridge.", "On the other side are some forest ground trails as well as trails from tree to tree.  The tree to tree trails (via little suspension bridges) felt much better for my fear of heights.  There is also a trail that takes you down near to river to view the famed suspension bridge from below.  A quick break at the tuck shop for hot chocolate and otter balls, we recrossed the main suspension bridge.", "Here we took another trail - but this was a single file system walking path suspended over the river (see second photo).  Although it was extremely secure (it did not sway at all), I found this trail to be more height-fearing than the suspension bridge.", "The trail ends at the big souvenir shop that has everything one needs to remember their grand day out - included a \"I Survived\" shirt.

With the treetop trails and the trail suspended over the river, it was indeed much more than simply walking across a suspension bridge.  A fun day for all.", "It's a fun park and a nice way to pass the day. The main bridge does swing a lot. It seems it gets very crowded in the summer, but on a weekday in March it was not very busy. Across the bridge is a series of boardwalks and smaller bridges suspended from the trees. The cliff walk is fun but kind of intense - be cautious if you are afraid of heights. The gift shop is expansive.", "The park itself is great. The suspension bridge is exciting and really fun to walk across and the supplementary exhibitions that they have added including the tree top and cliff walk makes the trip even better. Ticket prices are extremely high and makes it hard to justify if you go with a bunch of friends and especially a family where you cannot share ticket costs and have to shoulder everything in one lump sum. Add on the price of parking....", "I really think that if they lowered the ticket costs and made parking free the experience would be 5 stars.", "Loved the park. We were there for 9am which meant it was relatively quiet and therefore crossed the bridge with very few others.

I told Guide clearly that as per my booking it should be 1 hour and actually even 1 hour is too tight. He did not argue with me but I knew that I could not do much except getting frustrated. The tour was incomplete at this lake. Other lakes timing were also not as promised but Bow Lake timing was reasonable. Peyto Lake timing was shorter. Both Bow Lake and Peyto lake should have been 1 hour each. I told the guide clearly that if I knew this is the time given then I would have booked another tour with exact same coverage at 40% lower cost and was available on Viator.

As Louis Jolliet goes under the bridge to the island, we begin to see the massive Montmorency Falls.  These are higher than Niagara Falls but not as wide.  We visited the Falls earlier on our visit.

Prior to the trip we were informed on what to wear what to bring where to meet and what time. An itinerary was also given to us to know what to expect.

We would highly recommend this trip to anyone wanting to visit the Banff National Park.", "The views were incredible . Our guide , Gordon , was brilliant , very patient informative and funny . He also helped us take family pictures . This trip is a great way to see the area and to stop off at lots of beautiful places we probably couldn’t have reached otherwise .

However Micko drove a few of us into the town centre as I wanted to go up the small Skylon tower which is a replica of the one in Toronto only not quite as tall.

Some people went off for expensive lunches but I explored a bit more and just had a quick lunch in the Casino food court. After which I headed down to the falls to take photos. We had about 3 hours to look around which was plenty of time. It is not too touristy at this time of year, for example our trip only runs twice weekly in March instead of every day as it does from May to November.

We met at the Information booth at the center of town and were brought to five or six \"ghostly\" spots on the tour. Our guide was interesting and informed.

Asher was very alert of each of us as we walked throughout downtown making sure we were safe, sticking together, could hear hear him and that we were enjoying it. This tour was so different to any other city excursion I have been on and something very unique to Victoria. It was cool walking around the next day and remembering all the places that Asher talked about that had the ghostly accounts– it made me feel closer to the city. It was also a good mix of stories– some were a bit more creepy than others, some just really interesting, some were silly and funny. I went with my mom and we both really enjoyed it! Thank you Asher for a memorable experience in beautiful Victoria! :)", "How far is this tours starting point from where  the Holland America cruise ship docks in port?.

We were handed over to the local guide Richard, who explained the history and present status of Quebec, shown us the landmarks and took us to the top. You have to climb stairs, it was tiresome, those with walking issues can take the Funicular to the top (C$5 per person one way). The city is beautiful, with serpentine lanes full of restaurants, both souvenir and cosy shops, gallery etc. We have 45 minutes to stroll then come back to board the Cruise. It was about 2 hour cruise on St Lawrence river and see the shoreline both ways. After the cruise another 2 hours to roam in Quebec at your own pace, then board the bus, a 3 hour drive to Montreal, no stop in between. We were dropped off at hotel by the same private car. The only negative point was the style of explanation by the Tour Manager. He was explaining in English, French and Chinese. But his style of speaking was so cumbersome that it's hard to understand, very boring. On the other hand Richard, the local guide in Quebec City was far better, speaking in English and French, explaining in a  very interesting way.

It was value for money.", "Quebec City was really pretty and definitely worth a visit. This tour was alright, it did cover most places indicated. However, a thing to note is that other than montmorency falls (1h) and the cruise (1.5h) the other places were covered in a 1 hour city tour. We were given about 2h for self tour of the city and the rest of the time were spent on the road. Our tour guide extended time at the first rest stop (which was unnecessary in my opinion) and in turn cut short the time we had at Quebec City.

We signed up for the full experience, early morning pickup to last bus back to town.  We started in Johnston Canyon, and had a great hike up to the falls.  We then went to Lake Louise where we picnicked lakeside.  Our bus picked us up right in front of the Fairmont so it was an easy on, easy off at this stop.  Next we went to Moraine Lake, which was spectacular.  It was chilly so we went back to the bus a little early and had a great chat with our driver and learned a lot about the area.

We got it all accomplished plus we saw a bear during our ride on the gondola and had time for a relaxing cup of tea and a snack at the Lodge of the Ten Peaks in the afternoon! Absolutely perfect day!

Several stops were in awkward locations such as Granville island in the midst of a construction zone, outside the island. A stop at the market (the main point of interest) would be much more suitable. Even the point of departure was moved from its usual spot to a block away forcing guests to walk farther.

Thank you Rahul, and we hope our paths cross again soon – best wishes from Alabama, USA!", "Prepare for a trip of a lifetime! - Review below is long, unfiltered, and true of my experience- hope it helps others.", "A few factors for choosing this company and trips over others: 1) as a solo traveler, and a young woman at that, I wanted to pay a bit more than other tourist trips for a smaller crowd, better guide-to-tourist ratio, and also just to be treated more as a human than a number.", "2) I looked for a few hours on Trip Advisor and found that this one had stops that were not on others and were actually stops, hikes, and views (not just \"this is Castle Mountain\" from a ditch), and was not in a 20-30 person van. There also was time built in to enjoy sights for more than a minute or so, and some recharging time for food/restroom/etc.", "3) I knew coming on off-season, that maybe I wouldn't see everything, but that was alright. I wanted to get my bearings and also come again someday- not be concerned about packing too much in. But there WAS SO MUCH I GOT TO SEE AND LOVE!", "And I will come back - gosh, I miss the glaciers already, and Canada legit has better quality food overall. I live in flat, sprawling corn and soy fields as can be in Illinois, okay. Spent most of my childhood doing indoor activities in Chicago, enviously watching my classmates go to national parks and hike. I wanted a trip like this as a kid so badly, but never had the opportunity.", "I know the cold and snow rather well, but mountains? Not so much. And I am not that much of a hiker, but love trees, and am honestly trying to do more outside activities. I was a bit nervous even doing a tour of Banff, because I was not sure I would be able to keep pace with the group, even a small group. But Rahul my guide, and the owner- bless him for my mistake of an 8am pick up rather than 7 am, who called me on WhatsApp to make sure I was okay, picked me up in a Rav-4 from my rental in Bridgeland at 7:30 am, and we returned twelve hours later. So the itinerary time is true- this is not the company to advertise one thing, and provide you another, lower quality experience. Trust me on this.", "I did not book a private tour, nor was I expecting it to be just me and the guide, but that is the experience I had. And what! an! experience! I will never, ever, regret nor forget it.", "Banff National Park and the surrounding provincial parks are incredible, a must-see. I adored all the views on a mostly cloudy, misty day- but the sun poked through!", "We drove through glaciers and mountains, trees and trees for miles. Rahul did more than point out landmarks and provide facts, he went above and beyond anything I would ever expect from a tour guide, and I've been on a few trips in different countries. He personally guided me, helping me step onto frozen-over lakes, assisted me to not completely slip on the few steep paths to viewpoints and back, and even paused for me to take photos with my trusty, older-than-both-of-us, film camera. The company also has a phone for each guide, who will take photos and provide a link for you to download them at their fullest quality. So you can just breathe and feel at peace, rather than try to preserve the memory through your own phone/photo taking.", "Moose tracks were plentiful, as was ice hockey by the hotel staff at Lake Louise.", "I highly recommend Vista Chase! And honestly, I don't even know what to say was my favorite site, though Bow Lake was a gem and the Ice Field Road, though no cell service, was also hauntingly cool. Emerald Lake was lovely as well, when the sun came out, it was magical. The fortunes of Jake the bear at one of the pit-stops still makes me laugh, and Rahul's explanation of the trail/avalance risk map was really helpful.", "The Natural Bridge is really lovely to view in winter.", "Banff the town is, at least to me, a victim of over-tourism- I managed to find a local tea company and bought a painting of the glaciers from a just opened artist collective, but the town is overflowing with corporate, commercial souvenir traps aplenty. Any food you want there you can get, or even a Canadian Goose jacket, if you have the funds? Sure.", "Maybe, perhaps the company could consider a switch, depending on the season, to Canmore too? But I am not sure of the particulars when things are in high-season for them. Anyway- on the good food/bathroom/souvenir stops:", "Louise Village's Cafe had a lovely menu, great coffee, and a special lunch soup that was well-nourishing-though maybe I should have gotten a Canadian Doniar instead.", "Bring layers, gloves, and snacks. Most importantly- steady shoes and perhaps an extra filled water bottle.", "When I come back- and I will.... definitely book through them- I'd maybe do a two-day or three day trip to also hit Jasper, see Morianne Lake, maybe request the Toppical Falls, and probably do one day/night in Calgary and start from Canmore (not Banff, not my vibe) to cut the 3 hours roundtrip from Calgary. Hit the dinosaur fossil spot, too.", "The trip to/from Calgary is not a company problem, that just is what the terrain is. And I enjoyed chatting with Rahul, too- who also maintains all the vehicles for the company. I felt very safe, treated respectfully, kindly, with the Canadian spirit I've come to adore.", "The only stop we did not fully hike on my trip was the Canyons, but that's a me and my six-year-old Blundstones not being able to do pure melty snow/ice, and by then I honestly just wanted to see Banff, not a frozen icefall. But we viewed the water that flows there, and there's always another time, another trip with Vista Chase. Thank you Rahul and co for a trip of a lifetime!", "This tour did not disappoint! Rahul is a wonderful guide! Very knowledgeable and personable! My son and I had a great time. In fact, it was the highlight of our trip to Banff. His recommendations were spot on and we can’t wait to come back in the Fall to see the lakes in their full color. We 100%recommend this tour company! Thanks for a memorable experience!", "Unbelievable tour. Our guide Rahul was knowledgeable, laid back, and our kids loved him. He brought us to amazing locations with amazing views and experiences. We can’t thank Rahul enough. “Best tour ever!” as our son exclaimed when it was over. Thank you, Rahul and Vista Chase Tours!", "Naveen was an excellent tour guide and photographer. He provided a lot of information on all of our stops and showed us some great locations since we had a tour diversion due to 2 plus feet of snow closing the icefields pkwy. Highly recommend this tour and hope to do it again when it isn't winter.", "TLDR: I’m a hot mess and annoying to travel with. Naveen’s patience, knowledge of the land and unbeknownst skills of a professional photographer, completely turned my Banf vacation around. We only had 2 days in Banf.  Skiing at Lake Louise when you have 0 athletic skills and wear a long parka because you know nothing about skiing… is not recommended.", "Traveling with someone who has Autism and ADHD can be a blast… but also very slow and time consuming. I liked Banf because of Naveen (and the breathtaking views.. like seriously. Amazing.) We had two days there. Our first day was skiing at Lake Louise where I fell immediately and then took the chairlift back down crying. That was the vibe of day one.", "We were able to tour with Naveen on our second day and thank god for him. He was so patient and kind with me. We arrived 15 minutes past departure time because I lost track of time. Mornings are difficult. He was not annoyed. I proceeded to make everyone wait at each stop as I needed to take off and put on clothes multiple times. I had the privilege of sitting shotgun on a beautiful sunny day. So the sun was beating down on me and only me. Literally every stop, he needed to wait for me to get assembled before walking. He was able to distract the other family while I fumbled around. Thanks to his great social skills and fun facts about the land, everyone didn’t hate that I taking forever.", "Oh and he got a bird to fly on my hand. Like a wild bird. And got a slow motion video of it. This guy is legit. I also thought his name was Raveem the entire time.", "Also— don’t stay at a hotel that you need to be on time for a shuttle… to take you to another shuttle that you need to be on time for. It’s a nightmare for those who struggle with time management skills.", "Very much worth it! It was definitely a whole day affair (8ish to 5:30ish) filled with fun spots to explore. Naveen was a great and knowledgeable tour guide. He told us many fun facts about the area, the mountains, and the lakes. He was also pretty flexible with bathroom breaks and was always ready to take photos.", "The tour is amazing and the guide Naveen adjusted the schedule to meet the weather changes which brought us the maximum enjoyments. The introduction of the places we went were informative. The services were seamless and"], "review_date": ["Written April 7, 2025", "Written April 6, 2025", "Written March 24, 2025", "Written March 22, 2025", "Written March 21, 2025", "Written March 18, 2025", "Written March 14, 2025", "Written March 7, 2025", "Written February 17, 2025", "Written February 5, 2025"]},

Jamie was able to provide us with a route we explored on our own after the tour and it was amazing! Thank you!!", "This bike tour was very fun! We’re glad we picked this one since it included Mont Royal area, McGill university and the old port/waterfront area. Our guide was fantastic. It was a small group of 10. The bikes are very good quality. I upgraded to an e-bike which was helpful on one big hill at the end. The rest I could have managed without an e-bike, and i had it turned off most of the ride, but I wanted to try it.  Overall it was a wonderful tour and we highly recommend it!!!", "With the tour we were able to explore quite a bit of the older part of Montreal, which was great! The primary concern of our group was being in heavy traffic for quite a bit of the excursion. Our group of seven are all in our '70s and were uncomfortable at times riding along with truck, bus and car traffic on very busy streets.

The electric bikes are easy to use, and they have baskets that you can attach to your bike if you have items you need to carry along.

We saw lots of popular sites and learned a tremendous amount about Montreal and Canada.  The reason for the 4 rating is first of all because it is expensive.  Of course, you get what you pay for but be ready to spend some money.  My main complaint and the more irritating reason is they would not honor the 10% discount in the Bonjour Montreal guide and map.  They claimed it is an \"early bird\" discount.  I countered with \"It does not specify that ANYWHERE on any of the brochures that show the discount.   They still refused to honor it.

He also inserted his own family history which helped you to learn what life has been like for the people in PEI.  He provided political history, cultural history of several cultures, social history and the challenges of both the past and present. It was very interesting learning about the cause and effect of the decisions that were made in the past. He shared the good, bad and ugly of PEI’s history. He was even available to provide any further information about the area after the tour. He shared additional pictures and other documents to illustrate his stories. This was a wonderful way to start our time in Charlottetown. We would highly recommend Josh as a tour guide.", "Our guide was very knowledgeable about local history of this lovely town.", "We both enjoyed the walk very much!", "Thank you!", "We absolutely loved it! Josh was extremely knowledgeable, we learned so much about Charlottetown and Canadian history. He’s so passionate, being a sixth generation islander. Totally worth it!!", "Thank you Josh. TH and Roxy from Ottawa.", "This was an outstanding walking tour.  Josh, our tour guide, is a 5 generation native of PEI and provided detailed, interesting facts and anecdotes about Charlottetown and vicinity.  He even had printed maps, diagrams and other information to illustrate his talk.  I left the tour feeling I had an insider's perspective regarding the dynamics and goings-on of this beautiful city.  Highly educational and fun!  Strongly recommend.", "Josh was very knowledgeable about the historical context.

He was very thoughtful in reaching out ahead of time given the weather was going to be bad the following day when our tour was originally scheduled.  We adjusted our schedule to join and were so glad we did.  The 2 hour tour covers so much history and Josh adds just the right amount of personal touch and recommendations.  The group all enjoyed the time spent and we recommend this tour greatly.", "Josh was fantastic! Extremely knowledgeable and a well planned out tour. Incredibly enjoyable and fascinating - Josh covers everything from history to industry to climate change. Our group ranged from 40s to 70s and everyone was engaged.", "Josh did a great job covering the history of Charlottetown and pointing out all the relevant historic buildings and neighborhoods in town.  Well worth 2 hours spent.", "I just left a review. Your tour was incredible and gave us such a wonderful start to our time in Charlottetown. I really don’t know how you could make it better. I loved the variety of stories that you provided. You seemed very in tuned with your group. The pacing of your sharing was easy to listen and follow. I also liked how you provided the good, bad and ugly of the history. Very interesting!

I love walking tours, and I was really excited for this one in a city I hadn't visited before. Our group's guide was Madame Morphine, and she was absolutely brilliant! A gifted natural storyteller, Madame Morphine brought us to lots of different historically significant spots around Montreal, and some spots that time has sadly forgotten but walking tours keep alive in our memories. Being from Dublin, it was great to hear the Irish ghost stories! We learned lots about the city and some of the characters that are part of its history. I won't give away all the tour info so as not to spoil it for you, but I'd encourage anyone to book this tour. You'll have a great time!", "Note for the tour company: If you have a guide of the month award or something similar, Madame Morphine would be a very worthy recipient. She made time to answer everyone's questions about the tour and the stories told during it, and she also helped with general touristy questions. She was knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly, and she made the tour really fun and engaging for all of us. I've since recommended this specific tour to lots of people :) Thank you.", "I was genuinely excited to embark on the haunted ghost tour of Montreal, especially as we’ve enjoyed many similar experiences across the United States and beyond. With high expectations set by the enticing descriptions on the website, we anticipated an engaging evening filled with spine-tingling tales and eerie encounters.", "Unfortunately, our enthusiasm quickly faded. We ended up leaving a quarter of the way through the tour, as it became clear that the host lacked both the charisma of an experienced storyteller and a firm grasp on the narratives she was sharing. Instead of the ghost stories we were hoping for, what we received felt more like a history tour—one that was disjointed and poorly articulated. The details were often inaccurate, which detracted from the overall experience.", "The host's performance felt amateurish, as if it was only her first or second time leading the tour. While we understand that not every tour can be perfect, the lack of cohesion in the stories made it difficult to follow along. We hoped for chilling tales that would send shivers down our spines, but instead, we found ourselves underwhelmed by the sparse ghost stories and lacking excitement.", "While it’s possible that the tour may have improved after our departure, we ultimately decided that our time was worth more than enduring a lackluster experience. We had invested our money, yet the return was disappointing. For anyone seeking thrilling ghost stories and an engaging atmosphere, we would recommend passing on this tour. The organization seemed more focused on quantity than quality, as evidenced by the large group sizes and the evident lack of talent in the presentation. Save your time and seek out a more captivating experience elsewhere.", "Amazing experience thanks to the very talented Euphrasine!! She was very animated and a wonderful guide. We had a blast.", "The tour was absolutely entertaining, informative and captivating.  The Tour guide created a ghostly ambiance that took us through the sights of Old Montreal where history and legends were born.  Wonderful and interesting story-telling, we were immersed in the challenges of daily life during the  18th Century.  The talented tour guide added humour as she was in character from 1832. Totally recommend this memorable, insightful, enlightening, unique and wonderfully entertaining ghost tour of Old Montreal !  Don't hesitate - just boooooook ! :)", "Franklin was the best! He was very animated and told some great stories. Was a good spooky event for our Halloween trip.

The tickets we bought were for 2 full days, so the first day, we just rode around and decided where we would like to get off the next day. The second day off our tour, there was a bad fire in downtown that messed with the tour route, but we still enjoyed riding the double decker bus. Stops are close to the cruise port, Le Grande Ruoe, Basilica Notre Dame, Chinatown and more.", "This has been a miserable experience. We bought the ticket yesterday and they told us that we can use it the next day. We ended up only doing one stop with tbe plan of doing the tour next day. Next day, we found out that the stop next to our hotel is closed due to a walk. They did not have an alternative stop so directed me to stop no 4 which was more than 30 minutes walk. But the address they give is probably wrong. I have been waiting it has past the scheduled departure time by 10 minutes with no bus on sight. I had limited time to see the sights in Montreal and I wasted more than an hour to find the bus. My hotel called them I asked for a refund but they refused. Never using gray line again.", "I read a couple of negative reviews before I decided to go anyway, so I wanted to counter that review because my experience was really positive. Francois was an excellent guide, knowledgable and very entertaining. I switched buses after one go round and only went three stops, but the next guide, whose name I didn't get, was also really good.  No one \"begged for money,\" but of course they remind you that they work for gratuities. It's a really good way to get the lay of the land when you get to a new city and aren't sure what you want to see. Francois recommended the archeology and history museum and I have to say, it was an extremely cool museum. A unique experience I am glad I didn't miss.", "Wonderful time.

The guide today could use a hug and a bath.", "We took the tour on a Sunday. It left ten minutes late with no explanation, but we think it was to fill every seat. That meant when we stopped, there was no room for anyone to get on unless someone got off at that stop. People waiting at one of the stops yelled to us on the bus not to get off (because it would be impossible to get back on). One person who was able to get on the bus was angry about having to wait so long for a bus that had seats available. We decided to stay on the bus the whole tour so we wouldn't get stuck somewhere. The tour guide seemed to tell us more about his life story than the sights and was constantly singing. For $65 this was, unfortunately,  the worst hop on tour I've done in any city.", "Disappointing. The itinerary indicated you could start the trip from anywhere on the tour, but there were no signs at the stops. We had rooms close to Notre Dame Basilica, but could not figure out where the stop was and ended up catching a taxi to the main office. No one picked up a phone. Construction was everywhere and so the buses did not seem to follow specific roads. At one point we were told there was an accident blocking the road and we would not be able to catch the bus for at least 30 minutes and it might be too full for us to ride, so we took a taxi back to the hotel. Have taken several Hop On Hop Off tours in other cities and this was the worst! No headphones with the language you prefer. Live guide on top floor only who went through mostly English and French language explanations.", "Absolutely horrible experience!  Guide kept singing made-up songs including one about his girlfriend that died. We got off at the big lookout point to enjoy the view. After one hour had passed, we finally saw another bus coming (not in 15 minutes as the printed schedule said!) and guess that, there was no room for us on the bus!!

Online purchase does not offer any advantage as you still have to walk from the bus stop to join a queue at the office to get a wrist band. How about a QR code your staff can scan? 2. Queueing. It is a free for all, no one knows where the line starts or ends, this was a constant issue . 3. Lack of consistent information, I asked the rep at the stop for the time of the bus. Over 45 minutes this changed from 15 minutes to 30 minutes to 'soon'. In the afternoon a similar story but only a 35 minute wait. 4.The Saturday am tour (21st) was chaos, a lady who I assume was not an actual guide, kept apologising saying the lack of guides/drivers was due to cruise ships? conventions?.  It seemed to be anything that came to mind. She had very few facts or insights regarding Montreal and seemed to be winging it.  This did not stop her reminding us that we could tip her and the driver!  5. People attempting to 'hop on' at early stops simply could not board. 6. Later that same day we tried again, still chaos, people boarding buses and having to get off again. Things improved when a woman took over the 'clipboard' duties at least in terms of communication. Ironically she was instructed to leave that job for other duties and we returned to 'The Sound of Silence' 7.The quality of the guide on the second trip appeared to be much more informed, unfortunately we were only on the bus for a short while.  8.Sunday (22nd) chaotic again, this time due to the marathon (wonder why we were not informed when buying our tickets the previous day?). Poor value, unprofessional and total lack of customer care. I received a request to submit a review by the company, surpisingly when the system 'encountered a problem'. As of this moment there has been a whirling circle on a greyed out screen. I guess that is one way of filtering bad news. My advice is to use the excellent public transport system ($11 for 24 hours) armed with a reasonable guide book and do the old town on foot. You will save money, learn more and have control of your time.", "We have been on some very good Gray Line tours and so were disappointed that this one was poor. The route is quite short compared to other cities but the tickets are expensive, they last for two days but you only really need one day for orientation, once you know where places are and the metro or city buses are better for getting about downtown. On the day we went the buses were very crowded and we had to do some legs downstairs. Completely useless as the windows are too high and too dirty to see out of.", "I loved that we were able to hop on and off for 2 days. We learned a lot about", "Montréal through our guides, but sometimes it was difficult to understand some of them due to their accent, and another guid held the mic too close so she was garbled . Overall, a good experience.", "Done many of these in different cities.  This was about the same. Did have to wait for an hour for a bus at the beginning but once one I had no issues hopping on and off.  I asked if the stops were clearly visible and the answer was ‘just hop on the double decker, you can’t miss it’s but I did twice and the 3rd bus was full, hence the hour wait .  Michel was my guide for the most part, I enjoyed his stories and his singing (?!) but the couple behind me didn’t so they changed busses.  I enjoy the history given at these tours, I don’t care to find  out the cost of living or where the to Fb people live, my first guide was all about the money so I swapped busses too.  Once you find a guide you like stick with them for the whole tour then hop on and off as your heart desires", "Day 1 the buses were running on time and everything went smoothly but on the second day, I had to wait almost an hour for a bus at the start even though there were 3 buses sitting at the curb. The staff gave us not indication that there would be a long wain and gave us not information. Got off and waited almost an hour for the bus and gave up and took the metro. When I asked for a partial refund for the second day issues, I was told no even though I had to pay for a metro ticket to get back. I also contacted greyline online and they said I needed to contact the montreal staff who were not helpful. I would not recommend.", "Poor communication. Our 2-day ticket was worthless the second day, when we intended to get off at several stops. The service was not working on the second day due to the marathon but no one told us on the bus on day one. Neither the guide nor the ticket agent gave any indication of the second day issues. When I saw a partial refund for the second day issues, I was told no. On top of that I am not impressed with Montreal. The streets are filthy, the street people are filthy and harass visitors, and I will never come back.", "I have been on many of these tours all over Europe and the UK all of which have been really good but this one in Montreal was really disappointing. None of the buses ran on time - they were meant to be  every 15 minutes but we sometimes waited 30-40 minutes. Many of the buses were coaches rather than open top buses and the staff at the main stop and office were really unfriendly and unhelpful. would not recommend.", "Well organized bus tour of Montreal, guides are knowledgeable and entertaining  I took 2 trips and learned different things from each guide.

Our second day we got off and on which was great as the buses are every 15 minutes so you never have long to wait. Beware if you get off at stop 8 on Mount Royal and walk to Beaver Lake which is very pretty there is a cafe and refreshments available here , but we decided to walk to the lookout!! After about 1/2 hour we got to the big lookout by the Swiss chalet only to find the bus does not stop there as there are two lookouts! We were told we could walk on to the next lookout stop 9 but the mp is actually pretty useless and we were guided to the wrong path which took us down many!!, steps which were zig zagging down to the bottom of the park and not up to the lookout! 🙄 we then had no idea which way to go until we eventually  found a sign post up a very windy gravel stony path to the top!!

I had taken this tour about a year ago and at the time the guide just seemed to be reading from a script …  was much better this time !", "The first leg of the trip was really good.  We got off and then later on when we went to get on, we waited over an hour for the bus. I called twice to find out what was going on and the first time I called was told that there was a parade and the police unexpectedly closed off some of the roads.  She said it would be another 15 minutes.   Well, 20 minutes went by, and no bus.  I called again and this time was told they made through all the closures and traffic and they were “moving quickly” and it would be another 10-15 minutes.  15 minutes later, no bus.  So we took the subway back.  We don’t get to do the full tour which was disappointing and I find it hard to believe that they didn’t plan an alternate route because of the pre-planned parade. Regardless of if the police “unexpectedly” closed the roads. There was also nothing on the website with information about the closure and wasn’t able to see anything on being able to track the bus.", "Great way to get to know the downtown area. As it gives the option to hop off the bus and be picked up 1h later it's great!", "Do not buy 48hrs ticket, 24hrs is more than enough.

There was barely any history shared about Toronto. The information sharing was all about celebrities and where they live or stay in hotels. Who cares! I want to learn about your city and the history. Need to recheck your workers and get them retrained in Toronto historical facts.", "Buses also only run every 40 minutes so you definitely need to watch your timing.", "The bus was not busy...so I had like a private tour, almost like.the guide Marylin R.

This means that wherever you get off, you’ll need to wait two hours for the next bus to arrive. As a result, the \"hop-on-hop-off\" experience becomes very limited and frankly, quite unpleasant.", "Despite the reduced service, the prices remain the same as in the summer, which means you’re paying full price for a significantly downgraded experience. I would not recommend this service in the winter, as it feels completely overpriced and inconvenient.", "Do not book this in the winter.  It is a ripoff.  Only one bus running so we could not hop off because wait for the bus is over 2 hours.  The tour guide was awful.", "I toured the city while my wife and daughter were at the Taor Swift eras tour. This was a special evening tour and not the normal hop on hop off tour. The tour guide was entertaining and informative.  The outside seats were little cold but there was a heater inside the bus.", "I joined the Full day Niagara Falls tour with City Sightseeing Tours on 5/11/24 during my recent visit to Toronto. They are very good and professional. The guide and driver with my group was Michael who picked me up from the hotel I was staying bright and early on the morning we depart. Michael was clearly very proud that he was Toronto born and bred and did not hesitate to educate us about Toronto.  It was an entertaining trip with Michael except it would have been helpful if he had stopped on the way after 2 hrs into the trip for us to have a 5 or 10 mins break at a wash room as we did not have any stop for 3 hrs until we reached Hungry Moose which was really close to the falls. But Michael ensured that we all had a good time and that we all got our tickets for the boat ride at the Falls.  We stopped on the way at Niagara-on-the-Lake where we all had a wonderful time shopping and eating some of the local delicacies. Michael also arranged for us to visit the Niagara College Canada vineyard where we sampled  some icewines and other products. It was an excellent day trip and I would strongly recommend City Sightseeing Tours if you would like to visit the Niagara Falls. They are very experienced and provide excellent service, always willing to assist ! Thanks to Michael and City Sightseeing Tours for such an awesome experience at the Falls and all the stops in between !", "We've done quite a few of these tours around the world - so it always works well for helping us learn the layout of the city and working out where we would like to go later on in our stay in the city.  However, the guides didn't really enthuse anyone enough to get on or off any of the stops.  This is really unusual and unlike any other places we've visited.", "We enjoyed the bus tour, very good for orientation of the city. Guide was good but not always quick enough to point out what was coming up before it was there. Not sure they’ve had mush training. Keen to look up the answer to a question. Yes the bus had a stop for comfort and coffee around no 12 but we were cold so great to warm up and have a drink. We paid a few dollars more to do the boat trip as well. Not bad but did lack professionalism and consistency when staff charged.", "Did the hop on hop off bus tour. Was a great way to see Toronto.  All the staff we encountered were very friendly. The guide was informative and funny with it.", "Took the one hour night Tour with Punch. Really enjoyed it. Punch was very informative and we learnt a lot. He and the driver were very friendly. Highly recommended.", "We booked 24 hour tickets for the hop on hop off bus and did the complete circuit.  It was a good way to see the city and also the easiest way to get to visit Casa Loma.  You can buy discounted tickets on the bus for attractions close to where the bus stops.  The weather wasn’t great and when there is rain forecast, they give out plastic rain capes if you’re going onto the top deck.  At one point, they did stop slightly longer to allow people to come downstairs when the heavy rain started.  Definitely a great way to get your bearings on the city, and we discovered that our hotel was closer to some attractions than we had realised.  Recommended.", "Our tour guide Punch was fantastic! He gave everyone onboard a ton of great facts of the sights we passed, events that were actively going on in the city for us to check out, and (my personal fav) food recommendations. He was very knowledgeable, helpful, and attentive to everyone onboard. :)", "My family was very pleased with our overall tour and our tour guide Punch!", "We were however, NOT pleased by the behavior presented that day around 1:00pm from our bus driver. We observed our bus driver talk down very poorly to our tour guide and it made us all very uncomfortable.

Great food and drink with local history thrown in! Connor our guide was brilliant. Would whole -heartedly recommend", "My husband and I did this tour recently and would recommend it. We were able to sample lots of different foods from typical Canadian favorites like poutine, to Japanese, Italian and some sweets. We also were able to try local beer and wine which were all very good. Our guide Gabriel, who apparently was new to his job was quite good ( you would never know). He was friendly, knowledgeable and entertaining.  Our guide also gave us a decent amount of history of the Gastown neighborhood which was interesting as well.

Lots of different food and drinks and our guide Diego was very attentive and very knowledgable.", "First the good.  It was a sunny day.  No rain yea!", "Now the rest of the review.   This was a very rushed affair to put it mildly.  Our group consisted of 12 tourists from varied cities in The US and UK.   The drink offerings are red or white wine at most stops and beer at one place with substitutes for those who prefer non-alcoholic choices.   The food, in appetizer portions, was exceptional however you had perhaps 5 minutes to consume the wine and food before you were hustled back out onto the street.  Neither of us appreciated being pushed to consume the food quickly but would have rather enjoyed having Diego provide some of the street history regarding Gastown while we were taste testing and getting a feel for the establishment.   Diego’s presentation didn’t sell us with enthusiasm or his voice.   Perhaps cut out a few food stops to slow the pace down at the remaining spots and when working with a large group use a mic if you have a voice that doesn’t carry.  Can’t hurt.", "If you have 3 hours in downtown Vancouver and you enjoy a fun, interesting, history-filled, delicious food and drink tour, do this.

He took us on a scenic route in to Niagara with a number of historic and interesting stops before the big Falls.  This was the flagship part of our city break and it did not disappoint.  The falls are so impressive.  Unfortunately the water was still frozen so we have to go up the Skylon tower instead of boats, but this gave a different perspective on the area.  A little tip is encouraged at the end, but I had no bother in providing this as it surpassed all expectations.  We had a clear day, which definitely makes the difference.  Crisp and cold, but clear.  Well worth a visit either this time of year (April) or October time.  Crowds were low, and we got right to the edge straight away.  I can imagine crowds and parking would be a nightmare in the summer so bear this in mind.  Thoroughly recommend.", "Alex was a knowledgeable and most informative tour guide.

Highly recommended!", "Fun experience with a knowledgeable guide, David. We made 6 food stops, learned a bit about the history of Montreal and finished with a pastry and beer.  Highly recommend!", "Such a fun tour. Got to sample a bunch of different foods and our guide Louie gave us lots of info on the area.", "Our tour guide was able to answer all our questions of the surrounding area.

He shared fascinating insights into the history and culture of Montreal, making the experience both engaging and enriching. We enjoyed great conversation and, of course, incredible food.", "Our first stop was for a traditional Montreal bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon—a perfect start. Next, we visited a charming bakery for some delicious cheesecake. From there, we headed to a Mexican restaurant, where we had the fun experience of making our own guacamole—it was amazing! We then indulged in a classic Montreal dish: poutine with smoked meat, which was simply fantastic. To top it all off, we visited a microbrewery, pairing craft beer with a Québecois canelé.", "It was a fantastic deep dive into the flavors and culture of Old Montreal. Darren deserves kudos for being not only incredibly knowledgeable but also wonderfully personable. A five-star tour all around!", "David led six of us on an incredibly well", "Informed historical, cultural and architectural journey through Old Montreal, while making sure we had wonderful taste experiences along the way. He was genuine, funny and with US and Canadian tour members, explained some complex history  between the French and English really well. Personally, I would have preferred more focus on local cheese and charcuterie paired with some wine.  The poutine with a Spanish flare - to die for and so was the lamb!   We took the 11 am tour- do not eat breakfast!!!! The local businesses we visited truly want you to have a great experience and the portions were generous. We walked quite a bit and it was great exercise for all of that food.  It was cold walking - so dress warm. Thank you again for a trip highlight David!", "Very great experience. Your guide Fran was THE BEST!", "Extremely good tastings and very good walking tour with lots of history of Montreal.", "Amazing tour, I highly recommend Fran! She was very knowledgeable about history, background of the food, and changes that have occurred in the recent history of the city and of Canada. My son (12) was also on the tour with me and he had a great time trying new foods and walking around the city.", "Me and my friend were only in Montreal for two days, so we wanted to make the most of our time. This tour was the perfect way to learn about Montreal from a local (Fran was the best!), eat delicious food, and see the sights of Old Montreal.

And so many tastey bites along the way.", "Darren's guide style was engaging and accessible.", "Would definitely recommend this to others.   And plan to do the Mile-End version on a future visit to Montreal", "Would someone who doesn’t eat meat besides seafood,  have options and be able to enjoy this tour?", "yes, the French onion soup was not made with beef broth at the place we stopped at--very tasty.  Also, it is paired with red wine.  There is a dessert stop as well.  I have a sensitivity to beef--the only thing I could not eat was the pontine at the last stop--it had meat and gravy on fries.  I did not tell the tour company beforehand--so I did not eat it--but the tour company was so great with other questions!  Laura was our tour guide!

The amazing weather was a great help but the boat (catarmaran) was the best way to do this!  It has so  many areas to watch from, was incredibly comfortable, offered protection from the wind and cold when travelling and had bathrooms which is a huge plus compared to others! The crew, Sandy, Reid, Lindsey and Michael were exemplary! Knowledgeable, friendly, informative and clearly passionate about what  they do! Definitely up there with the best of the best! Thanks for showing us a wonderful day!!", "The whole experience was incredible! The crew were so helpful and knowledgeable; Richard, Connor, Michael and Eden 10/10. We felt very lucky to have seen two Orcas and a Humpback, it was a once in a lifetime experience and I would recommend this company to anyone…so professional and totally animal welfare first.", "This tour far exceeded our expectations! The crew clearly knew where the whales were hanging out. On board naturalists, Reid and Maddie, along with Captain Richard and First Mate Sandy provided a detailed narrative of the whale behavior. We spent about an hour watching T3 and her family frolic. Highly recommend!", "One of the top things my mum wanted to do when coming on holiday to visit me in Canada was see the wildlife. And I'm super glad to say that this tour delivered!!! We were lucky enough to have beautiful weather and see 4 orcas! The crew working were full of great facts and took amazing photos so we didn't have to worry about preserving memories, instead being able to enjoy the moment. I loved that we went to several different locations known for different animals, giving us a varied experience, definitely an experience worth the cost and something we would both jump at doing again. Thank you to our crew: Richard, Sandy, Reid, Megan & Eden for giving us a fantastic experience!!!", "Today we have a great time with captain Richard, Tayler, Conner, Eden and Michael. We saw the killing whale and the humback whale and a lot off bold eagels.", "The whale watching trip was amazing. We saw some Orcas hunting and sharing a meal. Beautiful day, too! All the staff were great especially Reid, Taylor, Eden, and Michael.", "Amazing tour! Watched a pod of Orca hunting - fascinating. Thanks to the friendly staff, Michael, Eden & Reid for the free coffee & cocoa and for providing lots of interesting facts about the Orca. Thanks also to Captain Richard and First Mate Taylor for a smooth and enjoyable ride!", "Early online booking made check-in quick and easy. The Captain greeted us at the dock and gave us a brief intro to the tour. The Salish Sea Eclipse is a beautiful and quite new aluminum catamaran with both outdoor and indoor seating areas and two marine heads (washrooms). The main cabin was very comfortable, with expansive ceiling to near-floor windows that provided great viewing.", "After traveling at a high speed out into the Salish Sea, the engines slowed and finally stopped. Several Orcas had become visible while swimming casually at the surface. We watched at a distance for several minutes until suddenly their behavior changed. They began darting in different directions, splashing at the surface, and slapping their tail fins on the water. According to the marine biologists who were our guides - they were hunting! Their prey? One or more harbor seals.", "We could sense the Orcas' effort as their labored breathing could be heard across the water. The hunt seemed to last another ten minutes, as the frenetic chase gradually moved very close to a small rocky shoal. Did their prey escape to the land mass? I was personally happy not to know. Nature is beautiful but with inevitable moments of cruelty. Thank you to The Prince of Whales for bringing us that close. And a big thanks to our Captain Richard, First Mate Taylor, and naturalists Michael, Eden, and Reid. It truly was a pleasure!", "Will be tours still run in December?

Each previous trip that day saw humpback whales apparently but we saw only the dorsal fin of a minke.

No guarantees on whales - take your chances especially in late July.  Perhaps better to go earlier in day but hard to say - it was also very windy so lots of challenges.

The crisp morning and and light fog added to the magic of the day. I will definitely be back next trip !", "We did a private whale tour to put a loved ones remains out to sea.

It made what could’ve been a sad time into the most wonderful fun memory for all of us. Thank you for all that you do.

The boat trip was REALLY fun... the crew sings folk songs and then the background music when nobody is talking is Irish folk music which is so happy! We came to an island that literally had 1 MILLION birds. It was awe inspiring to me. PUFFINS galore!! I love those little guys!! I opted for the shuttle service which was on time and the driver was a local named Janice. Janice is a lovely lady with great information about the area. I love Janice!", "Well organized-crew was entertaining and helpful. Ice cold beer available (cash needed). There was so many puffins! Slowed down so you could focus but kept the tour moving along.

Stop and have a bite to eat or Hot Choc at the restaurant up the stairs, great views. Stopping in at Capilano Bridge on our way back, the entire area was decorated with Christmas Lights, it was amazing.

Anyway, Rav, the driver guide, was very accommodating and he stopped in many scenic places along the way so we could take pictures.  It would have been helpful if he had a head microphone as being in the back seat in a small car, it was sometimes hard to hear him.  He took us to the Alexander Graham Bell Museum in Baddeck which took us about 2 hours (A Highlight of our Trip to Cape Breton: he paid for our admission) and returned to pick us up and continue around the Cabot Trail to enjoy the beauty of that island.  He took us to a Tim Horton's to get coffee once but we didn't make any lunch stops, so would advise you bring your own snacks if you want to have something to eat along the way.  All in all, it was a wonderful day trip but it would have been better to be in a vehicle with larger windows.

Not because of the actual tour but because of the email and customer service I received (or didn't receive.) I emailed the company that I wanted to find out what to do for a handicapped accessible tour, as my mother was in a wheelchair. I was sent sort of a general email back saying to look at the website and book a tour from there. NO instruction to book with a 24 hour lead time if you needed an accessible tour. We were on the cruise ship and because I wasn't sure when we would be disembarking, I didn't book a tour ahead of time. We made our way to the venue to be told they needed 24 hr. notice. When I told them about receiving the email, the manager said, they would have not sent me an email saying that. And there was nothing he could do because of safety reasons, they required to have a certain vehicle and an extra person for an accessible tour. And if they had known, they would have made it happen. And I responded, if I had known, I\"d have given them 24 hour notice. But...i didn't know that.I totally understand safety issues, so that is not my complaint here, just the reaction of the manger. So the rest of our family went on the tour and said it was very nice. But I spent the next 90 minutes on courtesy wifi to find the email that was sent to me that the manager said was not worded the way it was worded. I found it, showed it to the clerk, showed it to the manager and then asked for a possible discount, since 2 out of our group of 7 could not go. He said, no it clearly said to check the website. So I later checked it and it does say 24 hour notice, so bad on me. But in fairness, I did ask for specific instructions on how to book an accessible tour and that was never mentioned. So bad on them. And the kicker is that this tour company is somehow associated with the hop on hop off bus that is about 2 blocks from the hopper tour. We were denied access to that too, not because of accessibility issues but because they sold out. I still cannot wrap my mind around the fact that a hop on hop off bus could sell out. After the disaster of the first tour, our group regathered and went to the Atlantic Maritime museum. We stopped at the hop on hop off ticket office and asked if that was where we bought the tickets and how long was the tour and a few other questions. And I said OK, we'll come back and buy our tickets after lunch (about 1 p.m.). The man at the desk said OK. We came back and the young lady at the ticket booth, told me we are sold out. I repeated my story and she said well, we have sold out but I'll be glad to sell you tickets for tomorrow. Thanks but no thanks. I\"m not sure what's going on with the company but something is not being communicated to the workers or the customers. But it is clearly something they don't care about. So just be warned. If you want a hop on hop off tour buy it early in the day and if you want an accessible tour, book a tour time for later in the afternoon, so you will be sure to be off the ship in time for your tour--because you won't be getting a refund if you miss you tour and you sure won't be getting any discounts or sympathy.

The bus was spacious and comfortable, and it was a wonderful way to see a lot of the sights and learn about the fascinating history while protected from the weather.

The guide was absolutely lovely - very knowledgeable but also friendly and humorous in her delivery, which really added a lot of joy to the trip.

Cost is around $3 a person.  I didn’t notice if there was any luggage storage at the Visitor Center.  I took an afternoon tour which lasted a few hours and was quite full.  Not sure if the bus would allow a large suitcase.  You could always use that same time to walk around the old city and enjoy all it has to offer if you found luggage storage because dragging a large suitcase around Quebec wouldn’t be practical as the streets are cobblestone/bricks and uneven but beautiful.

My wife and I wasted half of our one day stay in Quebec City waiting for these buses until we finally decided just to walk.  No real guided tour, the headphones they gave us were cheap and hard to use.", "On the plus side, you do get to ride all around the city. Ours was a rainy day which probably impacted our experience. One really needs to plan where one wants to hop off because there is little in the narration that suggests activities. Narration is via recording. Solid meh activity", "Tour itself was ok. Getting onto a bus took almost 2 hours. There was NO ONE to ask about the tour. Lines were moved multiple times. Complete cluster.. sucked up most of our time in the city.

The tour was changed due to an event in the city and we were not told about it, even after we paid and entered the bus.  Once we were on the bus, we were told by another guest that the tour was not going to the places listed in the booklet and the tour was much shorter than described.  We found that it was not stopping at the places we specifically wanted to see.  The head phones and speakers did not work, the tour guide was very difficult to understand and at times could not be heard at all.  After we asked several times how to get to the places we  wanted to see and thought we would be seeing, he gave us directions how to walk there!

In order to see the city, we decided to take both a walking tour and a hop on hop off tour.  We purchased a 2 day hop on hop off for September 17th and 18th.  We got on Tuesday around 1'ish.  The driver thought he was a comedian.  Told terrible jokes and even said he hated the British and said if there were any on the bus, they needed to get off.  He laughed and said 'just kidding'.  It wasn't funny.  He kept talking and telling terrible off humor jokes. One of our audio inputs wasn't working and one came on almost an hour into the tour.  After an hour, we couldn't take him anymore and left the tour. Day two was no better.  This tour guide never said a word.  After he drove in a complete circle, that took an hour, and sweltering heat inside the bus. no air conditioning on the bus, we opted to leave and walk the mile to where we were hoping to get.  I would NEVER recommend this to anyone visiting.  A friend met us there and we absolutely would not let her buy a pass.", "Both this and the walking tour were a total waste of both time and money.", "Horrible. There was a bike race on the day of our tour, so most of the streets where the main sights are were closed, but Unitours still took our money and drove us around a bunch of regular city side streets. We felt trapped, but they don't provide you with maps or guides so we had no idea what was coming next or when to get off. We missed all of the main sights and the guide ran out of things to say. We just drove around looking at old apartments and office buildings. These people are crooks.", "Driver was terrible. The driver did not seem to have the personally, patience, or commitment to service that a business like this needs. The way he releases his anger/frustration put passengers at risk.", "He was erratic, often coming dangerously close to people walking on the streets and braking suddenly which pushed passengers forward in their seats and sometimes into the aisles depending on where they were seated.", "The end of our ride was the very worst of all. He started to pull away while we and two other passengers were still on the stairs trying to get off the bus at our stop. He reacted with a loud, exasperated cry and shaking his arms above his head.", "After we got off at our stop, we headed toward our hotel.

We were driven around to the main coach for the day’s adventure where we met Epaul, who was our driver and guide for the day.

Once at Peggy’s Cove, we were given an hour to roam around the village. This was plenty of time to see the lighthouse, get something to eat, and take photos of the cute village. Peggy’s Cove was a bit crowded because of other groups being there but it was still a pleasant visit. Afterwords, we stopped off at the cemetery that has some titanic victims. I didn’t expect to enjoy this part of the tour, but Jeff was very insightful, explaining to us about the disaster, the recovery, and some of the people buried there. I highly recommend this tour which was about half the price of the cruise ship excursion.", "We will be arriving on Princess and shows we port at 9.

So this is not the problem……", "Neither is the hard product, the organisation, equipment provided and the Zodiac boat is all very good quality.", "The issue is the soft product, and can honestly say of the 100s of wildlife trips I have done, this one failed the most of any in the department.", "1. Communication was very missing. Despite the Zodiac being hammered by wind and waves on the way out (again, understand this is nature and the elements were part of what we booked), it took 1 hour and 43 minutes post departure for the first communication from the Naturalist (or anyone else working on vessel).", "No checking in, no updates on where we are going, no info on other wildlife, no letting us know where we were (which would have been nice as most of boat overseas tourists)…..", "2. When we eventually saw our first whales, which was from other boats radioing in, we stayed for a while viewing Orcas, which is what we came for, but then as they got more active we left being told we going to look for other whales…. What we actually did was B Lined straight back to port (sure there will be a justification we looked on way back…..please….). Worst part was I saw a whale in distance (know it was, see Humpbacks all the time in Sydney) and put my hand up as instructed and was just ignored…. Maybe they saw the one docile Orca siting and they ticked box to avoid a no whale view guarantee so lost all care…?", "3. Finally, information provided was very thin and lacked real substance or knowledge, again having done many wildlife trips, found this to be the most lacking. I know he was trying his best, what annoyed us the most was him acting like it was a phenomenal days viewing when we all know it was what they would consider poor….. they are wild animals, we get that….reference and acknowledge it and all would feel far more genuine!", "Again, context is broad vs other global wildlife experiences and do not have info or experience on other Vancouver whale tours, but for for the price, this one a big avoid from our perspective!", "It was awesome to see killer whales enjoy their lives in their natural habitat which is very educational! And it’s very funny to smell the sea lions!!!", "This trip was an incredible experience and I highly recommend it over the larger boat trips.", "It's much more engaging to be on the water in a rigid with a small number of people, out in the fresh air and experiencing the waves. The boat is also highly manoeuvrable so can easily get to the whales, although the crew take care not to chase the whales or intrude into their proximity.", "We spent an hour with a pod of orcas, and the knowledgeable team told us all about them down to individual level. We then went to see sealions and seals on the rocks.", "Hugely recommended and something I'll never forget.", "Fun time on the water- go into these tours knowing that nothing is promised but a fun boat ride guided by a highly keen and knowledgeable marine biologist who’s able to make clear what whales are up to and what government and conservation does to protect their populations.

The weather was amazing, and Granville Island is also beautiful. I would recommend planning some extra time just to walk around!", "Absolutely brilliant day.

Highly recommended this company if you are visiting Vancouver and want a day to remember.", "Are these peices inUS or Canadian? And how us that charged on credit card? Also..looking at weather best to see whales on sunny days?", "I believe they’re in Canadian dollars. The exchange rate is good so it will be less than that in US dollars. Best time is afternoon.

Take off was smooth and we were given a guided tour of what could be seen along the way to the Falls, the views were stunning.

Adrian who owns and runs the business and is your personal tour guide was amazing - he was highly knowledgeable about the area, was personable and friendly (I asked way too many questions) and he went above and beyond (thanks for the recommendation about Cedero - was delicious - I dined there tonight). The hike is beautiful and picturesque - the constant drizzle of rain made it even more enjoyable as the river was roaring and the colours of the forest were so rich.

Unfortunately, this one was kind of wack. We came by on a Monday at around 12:30, and it was pretty empty. After visiting, I can see why because it was very underwhelming. We spent maybe about 20 minutes in total up there. It's a 360 deck, and they try to point out landmarks/key spots. However, most of the spots they are pointing out are actually covered by other buildings. The plaque will say something like \"Gastown is behind XYZ building\" without actually being able to see Gastown (just using Gastown as an example). Maybe the observation deck was built before all the other buildings came and covered it up but I don't think it really has any business calling itself an observation deck if it isn't going to be tall enough for you to see a lot of things. Tickets are $18 CAD, which isn't cheap considering what views you are getting. There are also ticketing fees if you go and buy it in person, and I believe on their direct site too.

We asked him where would be the best place for UBER to pick us up over there, and he offered to drive us back to our hotel quickly as he was repositioning the bus.

Came across this by accident on our road trip and decided to stop and see if we could get a ticket.  Incredible views on a clear day and the restaurant at the top was a bonus.

Sit and have a beer and a snack at the top and pick one of several well marked trails to walk.", "This was an amazing trip with a stunning view. I was travelling with a person in a wheelchair and the staff asked me about their needs to ensure everything was safe for all of us. They slowed the ride down to an almost stop so I could get on and off. The views as you went up were amazing but the view from the top was absolutely stunning. Do take the time to walk over the suspension bridge if you are able as the views over there are even more spectacular.", "Totally Fantastic all family members thoroughly enjoyed our day out. The views were outstanding so glad it was a great weather day. We came over to Canada on holiday visiting family.", "I spent some time debating if I should do this gondola or the Peak 2 Peak in Whistler, but ended up doing both. Sea to Sky has more hiking trails, while Peak 2 Peak is more just for views. If you're driving between Vancouver and Whistler, the Sea to Sky Gondola is about a halfway point on the 2 hour drive on the Sea to Sky Highway. If you're trying to decide which direction you go, it's easier to go when you're driving North to Whistler, since that's where it's located. Otherwise you'll have to make a U-turn somewhere. Not a big deal but a little annoying. We did the Sea to Sky Gondola on the drive back to Vancouver, so we needed to do a U-turn to get to the park, and another U-turn after to get back on the road to Vancouver. We planned it for a Sunday at 4 PM because they have discounted weekend tickets if you go 4 PM or later, so we bought the tickets online. This is a good time to go if you're just planning to ride the gondola up, get some views, and do some short trails. But if you are an avid hiker, they have much longer trails of varying difficulties, and I would recommend going in the morning since they close at 8 PM (weekend summer hours - be sure to check before you go). It wasn't too crowded at the time we went. There is a suspension bridge up there, which is the main attraction but there are ways to go around it if that's not your thing. We did two of the quick trails and in total, we spent about an hour there, which included the gondola ride up/down, suspension bridge, exploring at the top, and taking photos.", "There are two sides for the parking lot, with someone directing traffic. You need to pay at the meter/through the app for parking so don't forget to do that before you head up.", "Overall, it was a nice visit, though pricey. We paid $45 CAD compared to the full price of $67.95. If you're buying the full price tickets, buy online to save 10%, and you'll also get to skip the line. I'm not sure if it's really worth full price, but I'm glad we go to go on the discounted price.", "What time is the gondola open ?", "They open at 9am most days and remain open until 6pm week days and 8 pm week ends.

We met a guide just outside the cruise terminal and then were escorted by the driver to our bus.

So seamless!", "The tour itself covered the highlights and we had a spectacular day.", "The timing seemed right at each stop.", "Highly recommend this for any post cruise folks.", "Thanks again!", "We took this tour after our cruise, and before heading to the airport. It was a perfect mix of having a guided tour with the right amount of free time. I felt like I got to see all of the highlights and then some of Vancouver. Our tour guide, Kyle, was super friendly, knowledgeable, and made the tour a great time. I highly recommend to anyone who is considering this for a post cruise excursion or just to anyone visiting Vancouver!", "The places we stopped were great. I especially liked the Suspension Bridge with the treehouse. It was fun and quite amazing. It was nice because we didn't have to stay as a group, we could wander off on our own and meet back at the bus at a certain time. Our tour guide was Kyle, he was amazing and quite knowledgeable about the whole city.", "We loved our time on our Vancouver tour! We got to see the city and explore the sites. We loved getting to walk around.  Our tour guide was really awesome and had great knowledge and got us safely to and from our destination! I do wish we had longer at the place to eat as the public market had so much to explore and on a Saturday it was quite busy. I also felt our guide spent a little too much time explaining directions and stressing about what time to get back. He told us bathroom options like 5 times which I guess for some people is good! But we were ready to jump off and go after the second explanation 😂  overall I would recommend this tour! The airport drop off and baggage handling was such a blessing!", "Searching for an economical post cruise excursion to take us to the airport proved tough in Vancouver.  WE wanted to do the Whistler 10 hour day trip as our flight was not until 10:35PM but the tour companies could not assure us arrival at the airport in time  Our ship could not assure disembarkation by 8:30AM . So the compromise was this 7 hour Vancouver highlights with the Vancouver outlook and the Capilano Suspension Bridge.", "WE found the meet up place for Land Sea at the front street corner of Canada Place.

Van full , we started well after 10AM.", "Kyle as a young tour guide knew Vancouver and declared the real estate prices in each neighborhood. He had history of the city also. we saw bits of Chinatown, Gas town and downtown on the way to our first stop.   WE stopped at the Outlook to look down on the city a few blocks back from the bay missing all the bayfront beauty from ?53 stories up on a 360 degree walk around view. Clean rest room for those off the ship 3 hours.", "We next did a Stanley park drive stopping to see the city view and the totem poles.", "that covered 50 % of the perimeter as we drove across to North Vancouver.  The stop at Capilano suspension bridge was 2 plus hours and the main focus of the trip. Not ours as it was not for about 50% of the person's on the van. Too many steps WE had not had  warning that to go to  the suspension bridge there was a wooden steps of about 18 steps to go down to get to the wavering bridge.  I did get down the wooden steps by hanging on but the suspension bridge was swinging so erratically I had to crawl back out before meeting 1/4 of the way across. Not for the mobility limited walker!  The wonderful sites on the other side were totally denied those who could do 18 unsupported steps. Not handicap or mobility limited possible.", "The alternative described to us was the\" Clift Walk\" as so wonderful if unable to do the suspension bridge.  To do the cliff walk one does 25 spiral steps down to a walk way along the cliff.  The path rises and falls and over 100 steps are required to negotiate the Clift Walk Not for any mobility limited person.  FOR 50% OF OUR VAN THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO FOR OVER 2 HOURS THAN SIT WAITING OR BUY EXPENSIVE FOOD . Over $5 for a soda $7.50 for a hot dog. Over $6 for a single scoop of ice cream,.", "The ride after the bridge was quiet as so many were disappointed and \"felt taken for a ride\" Most of the cost of the excursion was the Capilano suspension bridge which 50% of the customers over 60 could not experience or enjoy. Admission at Capilano is $75CN for adult $70 for seniors. This was not the excursion they had hoped for.", "The driver guide Kyle tried to make light of the boring 2 plus hours at Capilano and brought us back to Stanley park to see the greenery and less busy periphery on the north west side of Stanley WE slid through English bay and then through the West End to the hotel drop offs. The tour was over with a plop.", "Severe afternoon traffic slowed the drive to the airport.  We got there at 5:25PM  Some of the passengers got enraged when the driver dropped everyone off at the dividing line between domestic and international flights. They presumed to be dropped exactly at their airline.  Rough for the driver.  WE had a very long walk with our luggage to our airline for Toronto at Domestic.", "This is not a n excursion for anyone who can not climb 25 or more steps unassisted or can't drag their luggage 2 or 3 blocks unassisted.  Railings for the steps are not reassuring on this excursion. Young people go for the shock value.  We saw nothing of the beauty of the far side of the Capilano gorge.  WE got taken for a ride.", "Landsea tours: Team Kyle! He was an amazing guide. Took us to 4 hotspots on a 1st time Vancouver visitor's wishlist: Stanley Park, Granville Island for lunch, the Lookout- stunning views, and finally Capilano Park entrance. So cool! Suspension Bridge, Cliff Walk. I'm afraid of heights, but I did it! (Side note: time at spots was perfect AND access to restrooms at each place)", "We really enjoyed this tour - The touring vehicle was very comfortable with high ceilings and good airflow.  Our driver/ guide, Bazel, was phenomenal!  Convenient pickup at our hotel and drop-off at YVR for our flight home.  Baggage was safely stored in undercarriage of the vehicle during the tour. Itinerary was wonderful for hitting cultural, historical, and geographical highlights of Vancouver.  Bazel was a wealth of information and insight throughout and very personable.  Many stopping points for photos and walk-arounds.  Suspension bridge walk was an exceptional experience.

The advantage to buying onsite would be weather related.  Make sure your online tickets are not for a specific date", "Hi, just want to make sure before we book our tour.  We'll be coming in on a Princess cruise line docking around 7:30.  The line will then take us to the airport, where I figured we could check our luggage or find a locker.  Will the tour pick us up and drop us off at the airport, or is it better to be picked up at the port and dropped off at the airport?\n\nThanks,\nMike", "The tour met us at the port and stored our luggage in the van with us  we had a fantastic tour and then they drove us to the airport right to our airline   we saved money and the tour was truly fantastic  we will do that again", "My husband uses a cane to walk. Is there extensive walking involved or can he opt to sit in the bus if people get off to walk? He can walk short distances.", "Hi! There was a good amount of walking, but the bus parks near the various sites. The most challenging part will probably be the area near the Suspension Bridge.", "Hi, I will be staying at Granville Island Hotel.

There were 17 people in our group so there was plenty of room (as opposed to ship tours that tend to be crowded).

At one point, he spotted some mountain goats and a bear.  We also stopped at the Suspension Bridge.", "We enjoyed the tour and the smaller group.  Frontier Tours is a family owned, small business in Skagway, which is something we appreciate.  They provide a good experience and we highly recommend them.", "Our guide, Connor was terrific. He is very knowledgeable and patient and even took his time to help everyone take family photos. The highlight was when he recited a famous Yukon poem from memory. That kind of knowledge was really impressive.", "We hopped on the bus to head to the white summit and take some pictures and view with binoculars. There was way more stops than the train one. We went into Canada later for the 3 hours that were remaining. We got up to the welcome to Yukon sign.

Please do this if you are visiting Skagway!", "Great tour.  He stopped for many photo shots.  Knowledgeable.  The suspension bridge was fun and scenic.  Even saw a double rainbow.", "We wanted a smaller group tour than the cruise ship offers. This fit the bill. Patrick was our driver and guide and he was very knowledgeable about the area. Traveling along the Klondike Highway, there were wonderful scenic overlook stops and a chance to explore the suspension bridge area.

Would recommend this tour.", "This experience was amazing.  We made a bunch of stops which was great.  Saw beautiful scenery, mirrored lake, Yukon sign, Welcome to Alaska sign, the suspension bridge in Canada and even saw a bear.  On all the stops, we were able to take great pictures and videos.

Is there a border crossing?", "Yes, you do enter the border (there is a Customs check, which is why you must bring your passport on this excursion), and the guide stopped at the Yukon border sign to take photos of anyone who wanted one.

However on the day we had a miserable guide called Brent who was not in a good mood. He was anxious about time keeping, so he kept rushing us and bossing us around like school children . The final straw was not allowing time for a lunch break on a 7 hour trip and being rude to me when I asked about stopping for food. My daughter is pregnant so she needed some extra energy. We eventually went to the restaurant at the top of grouse Mountain at 2pm and it was fine, despite Brent saying it would take us 2 hours to be served - absolutely ridiculous!

The bridge isn't that long and it somewhat shakes, but it's safe.  The annoying part is that people like to suddenly stop and take their photos.", "Take the free ski lift to the very top of Grouse Mountain you won't be disappointed.", "I just wish there was more time at each stop (perhaps 20-30 minutes more) there is so much to see and do.", "The day I was booked for this tour the weather was so bad 70% of it was unachievable. At the Capilano Bridge there was a constant downpour, therefore unable to explore the park and the Staff did not implement health and saftey measures at the bridge crossing and were allowing people to cross with umberellas and teenagers to run and jump (disaster waiting to happen). Arrived at Grouse mountain, fog was that thick you could see nothing and all activities and attractions were cancelled therefore sat in the mountain restaurant drying off until it was time to go back. When I got home I applied for some compensation and  was given a very disrespectful reply. In my opinion this tour sholud have been cancelled and a reshedule or refund offered.", "We had a great day out, despite the rainy foggy weather.

Brandon you're a lovely guy but not a great travel guide. We didn't feel welcomed on board. Felt like you really didn't want to be there. Lacked some basic knowledge of the area (which learnt on our tour yesterday). Salmon hatchery was a waste of time, time would have been better spent at the other two attractions. We wasted around 20 mins while Brandon when and purchased tickets at Grouse Mountain. Could easily have spent longer here. Salmon Hatchery and bush walk were a waste of time and spent way to much time there, which meant we only got about 70mins at the Capilano Suspension Bridge. Which is definitely not enough time. We will need to pay and go again to see all this attraction. Brandon drove most of the time with only one hand on the bottom of the steering wheel and on the way back went over a couple of curbs and cut very close when passing some cars.

So this year I did the lunchtime tour, so I could try some different restaurants. The variety of food was great, everything from Hawaiian food to matcha lattes. It was nice to chat with restaurant owners and hear their stories. There were also indepth stories from Andy, our guide, with lots of history about the city. So much fun.

And you can pretend you are wearing off all the calories with the walking.", "My husband and I loved going on this tour with Andy. It was a great mix of sweet and savory with an insightful historical backdrop.

Reading the quotes from people who lived in Britannia Beach and The Townsite/Mt.

They loved their safe, open-door community and they did everything together.

The bus is relatively small, so there were only about 20 people in our group. Our driver/guide was so knowledgeable and so friendly. He took us to so many beautiful lookouts, and if it was too crowded, he'd skip it and make sure we hit it on the way back so we'd get a better experience. We made a ton of stops and took a million pictures of the lakes, mountains, everything. We also got to see the sled dog training facility, which was very cool, and we had a delicious lunch.

We met the tour driver as soon as we exited our ship.  It was just a short (maybe 5 minutes) from the ship.

Our second stop was in Skagway, AK.", "We signed up for an excursion into the Yukon, in the hopes of seeing wildlife. We also chose this over the train ride because of other cruise reviewers who described the train ride as kind of boring and there were never any stops for photos.  Our tour operator Mike (I think that was his name) was very nice and full of interesting info about the area.", "We met up near the port terminal and drove to the downtown area of Skagway. We stopped for a bathroom break before we headed north. You definitely want to take advantage of that, because at one point we stopped at an outhouse for a break (fortunately I was able to wait until we got to Carcross). The town looked similar to Sitka, small and picturesque, but also more stark and rugged.", "We drove on a comfortable minibus to points north, making a number of stops along the way. Our driver spotted bear scat in a number of places along the side of the road, though unfortunately there was nowhere to stop and look around. We did spot one bear, that I believe was part of a larger group of black bears that had been in that area, based on photos from another person who took a similar excursion.", "We stopped at many scenic overlooks and we found that the waters were very still that day, for whatever reason. The ironic thing about that is that Skagway's name is derived from the Tlingit word skagua, meaning “place where the north wind blows.” For us, this meant fantastic photos, showing mirror images of the mountains peaks reflected in the water. Around every corner, we saw more and more amazing views.", "We stopped for lunch at a place called Wild Adventure Yukon (formerly caribou crossing trading post). The food was fine, and they had a small petting zoo, as well as some sled dog puppies (very cute).", "Our last stop was Emerald Lake, which was stunning (a picture of it is the photo for this listing). The tour guide told us that the color came from light reflecting off the marl (mineral deposits) in the lake.", "Then we drove back to Skagway, making a few stops along the way.  It was probably a too long day for me. By the time we got to Emerald Lake, I was done. Of course, this is all a \"me\" thing and doesn't reflect on the excursion company, Skagway or the Yukon.", "Overall, a very enjoyable trip!", "Today Conner, our guide. took us on a day long tour of the Skagway area and out to the Yukon. We enjoyed the multiple stops to snap pictures and in between Conner provided fact filled commentary on what we were seeing. He was accommodating on stops when we wanted to see something ...like the BEAR we popped up on the way back..we ALL got pictures . I recommend the tour and HIGHLY recommend  Conner as your guide!", "Aaron was a great tour guide. He was knowledgeable and stopped by quite a few beautiful sites.  The chicken lunch was fine. We would have liked more time in that stop to see more as it got very crowded. This was a great alternative to expensive ship excursions.", "Had a great time on this tour. The places we stopped to take pictures were gorgeous. Our tour guide Beverly was very friendly, knowledgeable and always willing to snap a picture for you. Very cool to see the different environments while traveling to the Yukon. We got to see a porcupine and, on the way back to Skagway even saw a bear!!

Connor our tour guide and driver was fantastic, his knowledge of the sights and best places for picture opportunities, as well as his polite and friendly manner were exceptional - i can not recommend this company enough, the whole day from start to finish was perfect and we got some amazing pictures, seen some amazing sights and have gained amazing memories.", "Our tour guide/driver, Patrick, was personable and informative. He was certain to make stops, or we could get photos and see the sites along the way. The views were amazing and the commentary helped us understand the history of this trail along the Klondike. Gold rush. Provided lunch for barbecue chicken was excellent.", "We went on an Alaska cruise with a stop in Skagway. This excursion was one of the best of all on our cruise. We had a small group in a comfortable tour van and a great driver / tour guide, who took pictures for us as well. Because of our group size, we were able to make more frequent stops to get out, walk around and take photos than the large tour buses could do. And we were able to speak with our guide, ask questions, and have a discussion. All this made for a terrific day. We returned with plenty of time to have a walk around town, and get back to our ship before departing. And we had new knowledge and understanding of this remote and beautiful area.", "WOW! Is all I can really say about this trip. The views the ENTIRE trip were just insanely gorgeous. The bus was clean, comfortable and had a great intercom system. Our tour guide Patrick was awesome!!! SO knowledgeable & passionate about the areas we saw and he went above & beyond to make sure we got great views & limited amount of people at each stop. We also loved Caribou Crossing! The food was delicious, the puppies were ADORABLE & the place was overall a great atmosphere.", "Excellent tour. Conner was an excellent guide and driver! Stops were beautiful!! Highly recommended! We saw beautiful lakes and a tasty lunch was included. Van was very comfortable. Vaughn made it very easy to find the tour!!", "This excursion hit the trifecta for us: breathtaking scenery,  exemplary weather and an awesome tour guide.  The Yukon makes for a great drive.

She also tied in how the global events affected the local developments (politics, religion, architecture, etc). Great tour and Judith was a really nice person to spend the afternoon with.", "We thoroughly enjoyed our private tour for 2 with Judith. She geared much of the tour toward us personally. My husband had a long career in construction so she pointed out many aspects of building construction in the city.

She pointed out so many details we never would have noticed on our own. She also made several good restaurant recommendations. The nice thing about doing a private tour is the tour becomes a conversation and more personalized rather than someone just talking at us along with lots of other people. This was a great start to our experience in Quebec City and helped us better understand everything we saw during the rest of our time there.", "Judith was so incredibly knowledgeable and so fun as a tour guide. I learned so much not only about Quebec but world history as well. She was an excellent guide. We really enjoyed  the private tour experience and felt we learned way more than we would on a large scale one. We actually got to chat and learn about her, along with the city.

Judith is a pleasure - she herself clearly enjoys the subject of Quebec City's history, which she can seamlessly discuss from any number of angles.  The tour is relatively free-form, as Judith adjusts the conversation to whichever aspects of the city you seem to be interested in (she even brings maps and charts, which actually made it even more fun). You come away with a real sense of this fascinating city, from someone who is proud of her roots here.  Highly recommended.", "Judith LaVoie was an absolutely fabulous tour guide.  She is a scholar, a professor, and a lawyer rolled into one.  With her blending of history and culture with geography and climate she entertained us while she educated us.  You can  tell she loves this business!!  She even met us in front of the house where we were staying. Ask for her by name and you will really get your money’s worth.  She went for 2 1/2 hours and would have gone longer but we had a tour of the Fairmont Hotel we had to attend. Merci, Judith!", "Judith is a gem. It is a unique cultural experience from the perspective of a native from Quebec City. This is not your typical tour with many people walking through the old city looking at sites and rote historical facts memorized from a guidebook. It is a tailored and personalized experience from someone who is passionate about sharing the history of Quebec and the Old City. Judith is funny and engaging, as well as a wealth of knowledge. You will not be disappointed. We really enjoyed our time with Judith. Take a personalized tour from a local. You will not be disappointed.

What an experience this was.

We did see some animals: moose with her calves (!)  elk, dear, a marmot, to name some but the drive itself was also quite enjoyable. Sam was very authentic and had a lot of interesting stories and information about the area including the effects of the 2024 fire. Definitely recommend.", "What a wonderful trip! Our guide Sam had so much knowledge and enthusiasm for his subject.  He drove us around while spotting wildlife, giving us lots of information without being overwhelming.  The bus was comfortable, and it was nice that there were only 8 of us on the trip, so we could switch seats to make it easier to see things.  The hike was beautiful and easy with sensible shoes. Unfortunately, due to the early season, we couldn't do waterfalls, and the cafe at Lake Maligne wasn't open,  but Sam gave us all a chance to buy some lunch before we set off. We were incredibly lucky to see lots of interesting birds and animals, but the highlight of the day was seeing a grizzly bear. Thoroughly recommend this trip.", "This was a fantastic trip where we got so much packed into one trip - waterfalls, lakes, wildlife and a boat trip on Maligne Lake.   Our guide was quite knowledgeable and mature. We had younger and less experienced guides on other tours (including the boat ride) who were fine, but this guide was a step above. He showed us everything, was attentive to our needs, worked really hard to find us wildlife (we saw a bear, a moose, eagles, marmot, and a dear) and provided an incredible wealth of information.  We could not have been happier or more appreciative.", "The guide picked us up near our camp ground.  He was really knowledgeable, attentive and humble.  It was a full day of waterfalls, hiking and wildlife.  Generous amounts of time—never felt rushed.  Saw marmots, pika, baby bald eagles, mamma moose and baby.  Great food at Maligne Lake!   Such a great day!", "Great day spotting wildlife and enjoying scenery. Our guide, Jamie, was very enthusiastic,  informative and courteous. Willing to give the best chance of seeing wildlife, even if it meant extra time.", "We had a lot of fun on this trip with our guide Jake. The trip covered almost all places in the Jasper National Park at a nice pace. Jake was extremely knowledgeable and humorous too! It was our lucky day- we saw 3 black bears, 1 moose (up and close), bald eagles, osprey and a few deers and elks. The encounter with moose was the most interesting. We were just 4 of us with Jake on the Maligne lake hike (most of the other folks had taken the Maligne lake cruise option). When we had walked just about 1/4 f a mile, we encountered this female moose, who got startled by a pair of rabbits and decided to charge in our direction! Jake took swift action and guided us to safety via some trees to keep a distance of 100 feet from the moose. We were able to continue the hike after giving a wide berth for the moose. Overall, it was an awesome experience!", "This was a great tour.  Our guide, Jamie was fantastic and knowledgeable about animals we might see and the vegetation that grows in the Jasper area.  I highly recommend this tour for someone looking for a 6 hour adventure.", "This tour was a highlight of our week in the Jasper/Banff area.  Our guide, Brett, was superb - gave us so much information during the drive, ensured we got the best viewpoints, and spotted several animals along the way.  We saw moose, elk, marmots, bald eagles, mountain sheep, black bear. He would pull over so we could get photos, but as a long time resident of the area and outdoor expert, safety around animals was always his priority.", "Maligne Lake has to be one of the most beautiful spots on earth.  The sun was out, the water blue, and the mountains majestic. The boat trip was spectacular. It was sold out via the boat company, so this trip is a good way to get on the water even when it looks \"sold out\".", "Highly recommend this trip, and if you get Brett as your guide you will be very lucky!", "This trip was amazing and so worth the money. Jake was our tour guide and he was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. We were able to see lots of animals such as moose , deer and a black bear .

Really appreciate the adventure. Can't say enough good things. Cheers to you all!", "All the photos are real!!  We were skeptical at first when we saw the sign that said “sightings guaranteed”, but we saw multiple humpbacks and orcas up close and enjoyed the experience of the smaller boat.  We have been on large boat whale watching tours before, but you are always looking down at the whales. Being on a smaller boat gave us a more eye-level experience with the whales.", "Be prepared that the whole tour is usually about 4-5 hours long. This is actual time on the boat, excluding arriving 45mins early to checkin, do the briefing with the naturalist and don some very heavy full body marine suits for protection from the elements.", "We were fortune enough to have humpback whales come right against the boat - they were so close we could have touched them. They swam directly to us which prevented us from moving. They were inquisitive, gentle, funny and very entertaining. An absolute unbelievable experience. Apparently in the 15 years the captain had been sailing, this has never happened - she was in tears. I doubt whether this could be repeated.

We truly recommend Wild Whale Watching!!! Thanks again Beth and Ashley!", "*BUYER BEWARE*  YOU WILL NOT SEE ORCAS!  Do not waste your time or your money. There are ACTUAL companies in Vancouver that will take you to see Orcas, this company WILL NOT.  I wish the reviews were more clear ahead of time and I had read the fine print with this company before wasting hundreds of dollars and half our day on a once in a lifetime trip to Vancouver to see Orcas.  The claim time and time again this is a ONCE IN A LIFETIME EVENT.  And it was, it was the biggest waste of time and money in our life that we won’t ever forget.  We spent four hours on an open air boat with no explanation of what we were seeing, what we were doing, until the trip was OVER.  We have been on half a dozen other marine mammal trips and wrongly assumed that when we booked to see Whales with a whale watching company that advertises seeing whales and shows pictures of whales, that we would.  We did not.  Not one.   What made this whole thing ever worse was a) they explain that they “communicate with the other companies to find the whales.”  We thought it was strange that we didn’t see a single other whale watching boat on our tour, and guess why?  Because they were seeing the whales while we were not.  When I asked Hillary, the office manager, Why they hadn’t communicated with the other companies or if they had seen any whales she explained “I don’t know, you’ll have to ask them.”  Which was very confusing seeing as how the captain, the tour operator, and Hillary herself explained they communicated with other companies before setting out.  So I asked the other four companies and guess what, ALL FOUR OTHER COMPANIES SAW ORCAS.  The final nail in the coffin for me was the lack of apology, accountability, and Hillary stating “If really you want to see Orcas I suggest you go to Seaworld where you can see one in captivity.”  This, coming from a company that literally advertises that you will see Orcas, and claims to be working for conservation, was just the most bogus thing anyone could ever say.  They offered zero refund or resolution.  They simply took our money, our time, drove us around wildly on a boat for half a day.  DO NOT BOOK HERE.", "Totally amazing experience and I highly recommend. Went with my daughter and our guide, Melanie, was super knowledgeable and friendly. Our captain was so great as well and gave us lots of time to enjoy the experience and take pictures. Was definitely the highlight of our trip and would love to do it again some day.", "Highly recommend Wild Whales. We had an amazing experience, saw many whales and had a great naturalist and captain. We enjoyed the small group (about 30 people) which allowed for moving around the boat to get nice views of the different whales.", "The tour guide was very knowledgeable. The entire experience was great. We recommend. Although we did not see any Orcas (as there are not many left in this area) we did see whales.", "What a fabulous experience. Whale watching was out of this world. Pascale and Darko were amazing. I would highly recommend this tour.", "Very kind and friendly team. Made accommodations when we were running very late due to unexpected traffic. The other tour guide company, prince of whales, cancelled our trip due to scheduling issues (not weather or anything, and weren’t half as accommodating as wild whales). Also Wonderful tour!

The first day went very well. Great guides, drop off and pick up in same spot ( though not always signed) . Buses ran about every 40 minutes and we were told that, so were able to plan our stays. Drivers would slow down for photo opportunities. The second day we started out the same way, made one stop, got back on with the intention of going to the War museum. The bus didn’t stop at the war museum because it was closed for a private event. I had checked and had planned to be there at 2pm when it was back open. We weren’t told when we got on that they weren’t going there. Because of this we didn’t get to go back to the war museum as by the time the bus looped around again it would be close to 3:30, the last bus is at 4:30 not enough time to see the entire museum.

There's a great little shuttle too to get you there. Walking is also lovely, especially in Autumn with the colours. There's a great shop with reasonably priced gifts and a cafe too.", "We stopped by as we were passing through the Hopewell Rocks area. It was high tide, and we weren't staying in the area, so our viewing was limited. I will definitely try to visit again when I can see both high tide and low tide where you can actually walk right up to the rocks. That would have made it a better visit, but I enjoyed my time there just the same. Be prepared for an extensive walk and allow a few hours for your visit. If you get tired out by the time you get to the end, you can pay a couple of bucks for a ride back to the start.", "Magnificent experience to walk the ocean floor among the giant rock formations.  We arrived at half-tide, watched the water recede from the cafe deck while having lunch.  Then walked for 2 hours at low tide among the rock stacks.  Fantastic day.", "The east coast has so many different looks and this another one. Best to go at low tide and walk on the \"beach\" and have a good look at the rock formations. Interesting geology and natural processes at play. Good photo ops. Very busy place even in Sept. To the north a beach with thousands of shorebirds passing through on migration. A nice hiking trail from the admission booth/main bldg takes you to the stairs down to the rock structures. You can also get a motorized lift if that's preferable.  Worth spending a 1/2 day during low tide.", "If you follow the tide time table, you can be there at the right time to walk on the ocean floor and see the fascinating rock formations really up close.   There is a small fee to get into the park.  If unable to or don't want to walk, a shuttle is available to take you from the parking lot up to the lookout.  There are many stairs though, to get to the ocean floor.  Challenging to climb them all to get back up to the look out.", "There is also a restaurant and gift shop on site.", "The pictures were impressive but seeing these rock formations in person and up close was amazing. We spent a couple of hours walking the beach/ ocean floor. The shoe/boot washing station at the top of the stairs leaving the beach was very much appreciated", "The views and rock formations here were amazing.  We took many photos.  There are a few stairs to go down to get access to the beach.  It is important to check when the tide is out, and for how long,  before planning your visit.", "Loved walking on the ocean floor and seeing all the different rock formations. Well worth the walk down to the ocean. Beautiful views.", "Visit this park for once in a life time experience. I was able to walk quite a bit during low tide and explore the rocks and the river. Make sure to wear good shoes even though I explored the area in my sandals. Was lucky to see the hide tide as well. Check the tide schedule before going so that you can witness both the tides. We took the shuttle both ways, costs$2 per person, keep the receipt for the return. The entrance fee is abt $16-$18 per person. The park is clean, visitor Center is very informative, you can get guided tours as well. Saw a group of people with a guide and he sounded very informative and interesting.

In fact we were asked to pay our bill before our coffees. Which were served as we were coming into dock. I’d only recommend this for the views of the city which were spectacular.

The food was very good. The constant complaint among passengers was where their tables were. Perhaps allowing passengers to select seats while booking would make some sense. Additionally, the service was unorganized.  They attempted to serve our main entrees before our salads. And they charged us for soft drinks. I can understand charging extra for alcohol, but extra for pop seems weird at this price point—especially given that we were never offered water or refills.  As for dancing—this isn’t really set up for dancing as a couple.

Also, the video of the story around the bear was difficult to follow for non-native speakers. Sound was not great and voice was also not clear. It would also help if Nicki would speak a bit slower, as that makes it easier to follow for non native speakers.  There was no real story line in the first part.

It was super busy and the organised program was dropped after 10 minutes due to the northern lights (but thats not what we paid for). While the people working there appeared knowledgable and nice, the set up was not professional and appeared as something that can be set up in your own backyard with a few tents. It was certainly not worth the money and seemed to be more suitable for retired people (or people above 80 (as that is what the group mostedly consisted of)) or kids, rather than young adults.

She was energetic, an amazing driver, considerate and a wealth of knowledge.", "For this tour I do recommend possibly bringing a charger for your phone because if you’re not careful you’ll run out of battery from how many pictures you’ll take!", "Running around Victoria was amazing and then going to Butchart gardens was the topping to a wonderful day.  Even in the beginning of April there were flowers and flowering trees (especially cherry blossoms and magnolias) in the garden and it was breath taking.", "If I ever plan a trip back again I’ll definitely do another day tour.", "I also recommend to always be on time for pickups. If anyone’s late it can mess the whole trip up and you’ll lose out on precious time because of the ferries. Thankfully my group didn’t and with our small number and timeliness we got an earlier ferry and an extra sightseeing hour.", "Thank you Sarah for an amazing day!", "Henry was very nice tour guy.

He gave us do much information and excellent recommendations for restaurants and navigating the ferry!!", "Long but enjoyable tour.  Our guide, Rodrigo was a great source of information.  Bucharest Gardens cannot be missed.  Beautiful and tranquil.  Much more that just another botanical garden.   Victoria is charming, very interesting and walkable.  Rodrigo made great suggestions on how to spend our free time", "Nice to visit while in Vancouver.  After a nice ferry ride from Vancouver visit the small town with BC parliament and the Fairmount Empress Hotel as a must.  Nice small merchant street. A day is enough.", "Very well organised trip to Butchart Gardens and the beautiful Victoria on Vancouver Island.", "The tour guide and driver Kyle was great and kept us all up to date with meeting details, ferry details etc as well as pointing out areas of interest and history along the way.", "This is an all day tour, but they picked us up and returned us to our hotel and we saw so many beautiful places during the tour that would have been difficult to get to on our own since we didn't rent a car on this trip.  We were fortunate that Byron was our tour guide and he was funny, informative, interesting, and he had endless patience with the tourists he was driving around.  He was an excellent driver who somehow managed to maneuver around the busy streets and still talk and explain things to his passengers as he drove along the way.", "We left our hotel at 8:30 a.m and didn't return until around 10 p.m., but it was an adventure to remember.  After picking up everyone from their respective hotels, we took an hour and half BC Ferry ride over to Victoria Island and then spent almost 3 hours exploring the beautiful downtown area of the City of Victoria. Byron pointed out places of interest to us and dropped us off wherever we wanted to start, and explained where and when we should go to be picked up.  We chose Chinatown to start because it gave us the best chance to walk all around the places that interested us, heading down to the wharf area to have lunch before we moved on to Butchart Gardens.", "Butchart Gardens are spectacular, colorful, and we loved every minute of our almost 2 hours just enjoying the well manicured gardens and flowers that were literally everywhere we looked.", "The weather was perfect and when we got back on the bus to return to our hotels, Byron entertained us with countless stories of his life as a tour guide.  We did a lot of things when we were in Vancouver, but this was undoubtedly our favorite Vancouver experience.", "Plan for a very long day. The gardens are so worth visiting and Victoria is fine. The biggest challenge is the transportation. You spend more than an hour  getting onto the ferry and home from ferry each way. Then you have 3+ hours on the ferry.  All that to spend 90 min at gardens and 3 hours in Victoria. Would have much preferred at least 2-2 1/2 hours in gardens and an hour in Victoria.  But everyone has different interests. Would have loved to do the museum exhibits if had realized they were available.  Can’t figure out a better way except rent a car yourself or use float planes which can be unreliable.", "Very glad went to gardens though!!!", "Basil our driver/guide introduced us to each other on the small group bus.He knew and remembered everyone’s names throughout the day. His knowledge was exceptional, he kept us all informed throughout the day. At the end of a long day he even arranged to get everyone back to their hotels as quickly as possible. A credit to the company. If you want to book a trip I can’t recommend Landsea Tours highly enough, they were outstanding.", "Can I take an earlier ferry back to Vancouver if I choose to only go Butchart Gardens and forgo the remainder of the excursion?", "They can make special arrangements for you.", "We are trying to book this excursion for August 14th for 2 people.  It appears to be booked until September.  Is it possible to get in on August 14th?  Are there other excursions like this you might recommend?", "We will be there end of May, will the gardens be in full bloom?", "Not there yet but we are coming before a cruise next May\n\nDo you pick up guests at hotels near the cruise pier?\n\nWill be staying at Pacific ...\nThanks", "Is there any ticket discount for kids with special needs ?", "not sure", "Olá! Esse valor de R$ 691,91 por adulto é em reais?", "ola usted quiere saber los precios en u.s dollars?", "Can I board the bus at the bus depot at Main & Terminal, Vancouver?", "Call tour company and ask\nThey were very accommodating", "How long in Victoria on your own and Butchart Gardens on your on?", "This is our first trip to Victoria with 6 year old son and 70+ year old grandmother, so as you can tell, we were sightseeing at a slower pace than most people. We had about 2 hours in Victoria and about 2-1/2 hours in Butchart garden. We were able to see everything in the garden and enough time for a quick lunch. In Victoria 2 hours is not enough, we were able to see only the outside of the Parliament, the Empress Hotel, the Marina and a short walk for window and souvenir shopping.  We will spend more time next time we go with one or two night stays.  We enjoyed both places very much.", "Can we do this tour with return ticket but have one night stay on Victoria and come back the end of the following day we would like to do a whale watching cruise.

Fancy but smaller tourist van meant we were comfortable, could actually interact with the guide and other guests.  We basically had 'skip the line' access to Behind the Falls, the Skylon Tower and Boat Ride - - amazing.  It was a beautiful day, so all our pictures are gorgeous.  Behind The Falls was such a special treat and angle to view the falls.  The Skylon Tower had spectacular views of the entire falls area.  And the Boat Ride was unexpectedly 'up close' and 'wet'.  I knew we would get misted on - but it was super watery and hard to keep eyes open as we rode into the circle of the falls.  It was everything.  This was our first visit to Niagara Falls and this tour really hit every highlight.  We also had some free time to walk around/catch lunch.  Our tour guide, Ryan,  was super knowledgeable and provided great tips to ensure we experienced everything we wanted to during our visit.  Highly recommend this tour - and Trip Shepherd in general.  We also took other smaller tours with them in Toronto - and they were terrific.  Merci from Maryland, USA", "Eshaan was our guide. I had him for the Toronto city tour also and he’s the best. He gave us plenty of time at each stop. The boat trip to the falls was thrilling; walking under falls;thunderous and sky tower. He knows the area well and stopped at various sites for photos . So happy I went with this tour company. Small group of 4 today was great .", "We had a great day visiting Niagara Falls from Toronto! It was nice to be in a smaller group and tour van. We made a stop at Tim Hortons on the way and our guide Daniel helped us navigate all the activities very efficiently and gave us plenty of time to explore the area.

We loved it!", "This was a great way to experience all the falls offer - from behind the falls, to riding into the thunderous storm of the falls (tip - wear rain gear or get wet, the ponchos protect little!), to the top of Skylon Tower, plus other sites. Plenty of time at each stop and for lunch. Going with a small group was great - we had very nice travel companions in our van. Not having to drive ourselves from Toronto and back - priceless!", "Daniel our tour guide was amazing! Very knowledge, polite and funny. The whole trip was planned extremely well, skipping the queues for the attractions and very well timed. The duration of the excursion was spot on and it was an added bonus that the minivan had A/C. Definitely worth the extra bit of money!", "Hi there\n\nI have two questions:\n1. I am booking for 2 people - myself and a friend who are staying in different hotels in Downtown Toronto.

Do I understand correctly that all admission tickets are included in the total price?\n\nThank you,\nNinela", "Ninela, \n1) They picked us up at our airbnb and then another woman from the UK at a hostel and then another couple at a hotel in Niagara, so I think they'll get you separately if you're in the pickup zone. \n2. All admission tickets were included in the price, which was the best thing about this package. Once you add the price of the tickets and gas or car rental, this was such a good deal. And, we didn't have to wait in any lines to get tickets. Our guide grabbed them and then they let us in as a tour so we didn't really wait in any lines the entire day.

Gabriella made sure we were safe and out of the way when she stopped along sidewalks to describe various points of interest.  This 3 hr tour was varied and in-depth.

The Icefields walk provided great views. The trip on the \"Icemobile\" and walk on the ice fileld was unique and worth it despite the cost.

This tour is highly recommended if you want to experience the 2 beautiful lakes without the crazy drives or hustle and bustle of the crowds.

The history on how the power station was built is fascinating. The show with the Tesla coils at the back of the station is fantastic, very loud but very cool. The walk through the tunnel is long but easily accessible, no steps, wheelchair friendly. Hard to believe it was made by hand and interesting to imagine that you are walking down a tunnel that used to be full of flowing water. The view at the end of the tunnel, at the base of the falls, on the platform is spectacular. Staff were all super friendly and full of interesting information. I’d highly recommend this attraction to anyone. Get a Niagara Wonder Pass and you can visit this attraction as well as Journey Behind the Falls, the Butterfly Conservatory and it gives you free passage on the WEGO Niagara Falls bus which can take you from attraction to attraction so you can park your car and leave it, it also passes by most major hotels. Added bonus it gives you free rides on the funicular (inclined railway) at the Falls too. Good deal!!", "Really good visit here. Was good to learn how they harvest power from the river.

The listening devices made it easy to do a self-guided tour and learn at your own pace. The walk through the tunnel was at your own pace with an occasional bench to rest along the way. The view at the end of the tunnel made the walk through the tunnel well worth the time and effort.", "Deanna was a wonderful guide--she is a retired Civil Engineer and was excited to teach us about hydro-electicity and POWER generation. The tour includes a trip up the Skylon Tower, then a walk with stops along the way to learn about the history of the hydro-plants and the Falls generally. It ends with the Power Station and Tunnel, which is a great place to visit. This is MUCH better than Journey Under the Falls -- fewer people, more space to move at your own pace, and lots to learn about the hydro-electric plant. The Tunnel is COLD inside and even colder after you get sprayed with mist, but a welcome break from the heat outside. What I appreciate is that the guide leaves you at the museum so that you can do it at your own pace. Lots of history and information, but good balance with doing your own thing.", "My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this tour! Deanna did a great job of balancing the technical details with humor.  So much history shared along the way!", "I had no idea about this attraction as it is fairly new! We tried to get to the behind the falls and even got the ticket at 6 pm on Saturday not realizing that means still another hour of waiting in the line so we got refunded.

David was a great guide, and one of my favorite parts of the tour was getting to race around the Grand Prix track on our e-bikes, which was such a unique experience.", "I went to Montreal for my birthday, and after much deliberation, I decided to kick off the big day with a city tour. It was the best choice I could possibly have made! David is wonderful—warm, wise, attentive, and funny, an expert guide who knows so many fascinating tidbits about his city. There were some new regulations regarding scooters and bikes on city streets; David explained everything clearly and gave us several options for how to proceed. We ended up on e-bikes—and I am SO glad we did! We got to see parts of Montreal we never would have otherwise, with a guide who made us feel safe and kept us smiling.

We did the afternoon one which goes to the east side - past old Montreal, across to St. Helen's island by the Biosphere, the Olympic Basin, racetrack (we rode on!), saw locks, farmer's market (a snack there was included) and more.  The morning tour does different neighborhoods - glad we did this one.  Really liked our guide - Frederick.  There were only 4 of us on the trip - could've been up to 20 so this was wonderful.  Wish we had headphones so that he could talk as we rode but we stopped a bunch of times and he explained the sights.   Had never ridden a scooter before but was easy to learn.  Helmets are provided and there are LOTS of bike lanes so you feel safe riding.", "Really great tour on electric bikes that took us through many parts of the city (Mount Royal, Formula 1 Track, Biodome, shipyards, etc).  Guide/leader was amazing - very knowledgeable and helpful.  Highly recommended!", "Great way to see Montreal. David is an excellent guide. He has good relationships with people in the community, which makes the tour stops all the more special.", "Note: Quebec banned scooters so we had to take ebikes instead, but this was even more fun! The eBikes had enough power to propel us through town and we got to go places where scooters couldn't go, like up the paths of Mont Royal park.", "Highly recommend this tour!", "All the praise you read about David, it's true.

Can’t say enough good things about  Katie C, Ali and Jasper!! Excellent commentary and the number and quality of whale sightings over-delivered vs. My expectations.

We managed to see Bald Eagles, Seals, Sea lions and lots of wildlife on the islands an beyond…we also saw a pod of Orca/Killer Whale so big tick off the bucket list !", "I was pleasantly surprised that we saw whales, which was fantastic.  What was not so fantastic was the driver's complete lack of safety.  The only thing he mentioned was that the front of the boat was rougher than the back.  There was no other safety briefing or information before, during, or after the trip.  Having done 3 other zodiac tours and numerous jet boat trips, I knew the front was rougher but wasn’t too concerned about the roughness as I never had any problems before.  However, I didn’t anticipate having a driver who didn’t care about his passengers or the conditions.  We had been drifting, watching the whales, when he suddenly took off into rough seas at very high speeds.  People around me were trying to hold onto their hats while others tried to secure phones and cameras.  None of us had a chance to brace before we hit down very hard half a dozen times.  Then, when he realised something was wrong, he slowed down to check on us, and one of the passengers complained about his lack of warning. His response was, “That’s not my style”.  He then sped up for a VERY uncomfortable trip back into the harbour.  When he eventually pulled alongside the dock, he didn’t tell people what was happening, so one poor guest tried to get out before he secured the vessel and nearly ended up in the water.    Others on the trip also commented the speed was not suitable for the conditions.   What should have been a great morning out was an example of what not to do.  Instead of my excitement about seeing whales, I only remember my bruised back, which hindered my first week of holidays.", "It was a rocky day on the water but Captain Mark is a great driver. After a report from another vessel of orcas seen some time ago, he went above and beyond searching the area. He was able to locate two brothers feeding on a seal. We also saw sea lions and many seals. Mark was great about checking in with the passengers to ensure everyone was doing ok in the difficult conditions. We had a great time. Thank you!", "It was a great adventure! Our guide Mark was enthusiastic and informative, and after seeing two pairs of humpbacks, Mark went the extra mile to take us out to see a pod of orcas that George had scouted for us. What a great team! They worked in tandem to ensure that we had the best experience possible. And what a great way to see out 2024. Thanks, Prince of Whales.", "Had the best time watching whales, I went with my friends, we were lucky, we saw 4 whales, couldn't ask for more. I saw some sea lions as well.", "The limited numbers allowed on the boat made the tour feel very personalised. Mark’s contacts and local knowledge ensured we saw whales.

I would contact them directly to find out what their cancellation policy is.", "Hello I have a large camera backpack. Can I take it in the Zodiac?", "I don’t think there’s room, and everything would get wet. Better to cover your camera with the plastic zip-closed bags they provide and leave the backpack in the lockers in their changing rooms.", "What are the chances of seeing whales during the 11:00 AM departure time?  Would earlier times be better?", "I don't think the time of day matters as much as whether other skippers have reported whales in the vicinity.

David accentuated all that we could hope for in booking independently: informative, conscientious, and individually considerate as can be difficult to ask and receive with large-group cruise tours in comparison. I'm especially and truly thankful for his attentiveness in terms of my group's mobility needs where no stop or distance was too small for his care; each time we were all appreciative of his efforts to look out for our safety and comfort. At the same time, David was also open and accessible in questions and conversations - life, history, and more present-day concerns and challenges, all of which allowed us to feel briefly closer to the longer-term, local experience on our one day out.", "As for our time on the trail: Beautiful. Certainly, the idea of seeing it in full fall splendor is wonderful, but the views of the coast and cliffs in blue and green still stand out as some of our best memories on the trip. A day's travel allowed us to get all the way to Ingonish and the Keltic Lodge, with plenty of stops along the way - beaches, overlooks, Gaelic College, and more. We were fortunate to have good weather, and yes, though the return was on the same road, a second look at the scenery was very welcome before a timely return to the cruise terminal.", "Thank you to David and to Cabot Discovery Tours for such a lovely day in Cape Breton!", "Our guide for the day was very friendly and knowledable. The Cabot trail is wonderful with great views and many interesting places to visit. Very worth going on.", "Our cruise had a pretty short stay in the area, but CDT still gave a wonderful overview despite our time limitations.

The photo stop and scenery at Green Cove along the Cabot trail - made it totally worthwhile!", "What a wonderful day!!! We chose this your while cruising with NCL.

He shared so many interesting facts and stories, both amusing and tragic.  The sound system in the van worked well, and there was an audiovisual screen up front, showing historic photos. However, we would have preferred more actual stops and less screen time to really soak in the sights.", "One thing I would have changed is the amount of time we spent in the cemeteries—just a bit too long. Also, Paul spoke somewhat negatively about touring Peggy’s Cove, which I don't understand because my daughter and her family had a tour there and were absolutely thrilled with it.", "Overall, while there were a few things I would have tweaked, it was still a pretty enjoyable experience, and Halifax itself definitely left a great impression on us!", "From pickup at our Hotel to drop off we discovered so much about the history of Halifax thanks to Paul’s encyclopedic knowledge of his city.

Loved the tour and the city of Halifax. Thank you Paul.", "I highly recommend this tour.  We chose this tour instead of a shore excursion from our ship.  I'm glad we did!

Thanks for a great day!", "Recommend without reservation, Chauffeur Guide Paul McNeil was outstanding.  Our ten person mix of cruise and hotel passengers was easily accommodated and comfortable.  My wife and I had already spend 3 days in Halifax but Paul's itinerary and historical knowledge revealed a much deeper understanding and appreciation of Halifax and its history.  Stops at relevant sites allowed pictures and a perception deeper than a drive by.  Has excellent multimedia equipment in the van which enables deeper background information than just his narrative.", "Paul is incredibly knowledgeable about the area, especially the Halifax Explosion and The Titanic tragedy. He showed us many sights in Halifax and surrounding areas. The only issue was that he spoke very fast and not very loud, so it was hard to understand a lot of what he said on the bus. It was easier to hear and understand him when we were out of the bus at the actual historic sights.", "Paul was an amazing guide and provided so much info about the area and knew right where to take us and when.  We arrived on a cruise but didn't want to do the typical cruise large group tour so we arranged a tour with Paul.  He was so easy to work with in getting it setup and he did such a good job of taking great care of us while we were on the tour.  Pictures and videos that he shows you while on the tour is so informative and is so much nicer than just hearing someone talk about the area and its history.  We would highly recommend this tour if you are in the area!  You will not regret it and if you are on a cruise this is so much better than the large group tour!

More like a 6-hour little bus tour of everything of any significance in Halifax. Paul knew more than anyone else has ever forgotten about the area. The only negative, and it really isn’t a negative, is that 90% of the time you were in the van, so definitely not a walking tour, just so you know. Definitely would recommend it for anyone that wants to see it all.

I had heard good things about it and we were not disappointed. We booked tickets online while we walked over from the Falls. The tour is self-directed. They give you an IPOD sized device to scan at different locations to listen to very interesting facts about this place and its history.  We all loved it. Fascinating!  And what a different view from the bottom of the falls. Be advised it is probably a 10 min walk from the elevator thru the tunnel to the Falls. The whole museum/tunnel tour probably took us 1.5 hrs but you could easily make it shorter or longer.  I would love to do this tour at night when everything including the tunnel is lit up! Everyone talked about this for days after. We were impressed. Enjoy!", "Fantastic tour! Really good value as you get the Skylon tower, power station (and tunnel/viewpoint) and an expert guide all included.

It was very interesting to see this large power station and have the listening device to narrate as we toured so we didn't have to read all the signs. We then proceeded to the tunnel. Although it is a half mile walk down the tunnel, the view and roar of the falls from this vantage point are worth it! Wish the elevator operator would have mentioned that there were additional spots to activate the listening device for further narration as you were walking, as we didn't realize until almost there so we listened on the way back.", "Power station is interesting if you're into this mechanical stuff.  Best part is the tunnel under the falls!  A little bit of a walk but an awesome experience.", "We took a guided tour. Must book online beforehand. Our tour guide James was super informative.

Great personality.", "Came in to Saint John on a cruise ship but didn't want to book a crazy $$$ excursion with the cruise line. This one looked like fun and was so reasonably priced. We had such a great time with Pete. So much enthusiasm and love for his city. Such great historical and current information and the stories were great too. You will not be disappointed in this tour.", "The tour was very good.  Pete met us as arranged and he took us uphill via a building with escalators, waling mainly downhill, so no much effort to manage the tour.  He took a long time on the tour and was prepared to address questions.  One of the best walking tours I have ever had.", "We had a brilliant time on Pete’s walking tour. He ran a pub in the city for 35 years and there is nothing he doesn’t know about his home . The love and pride he has for Saint John absolutely shines out of him . He is bursting with facts of all sorts - historical, commercial , entertainment, legend , rumour & gossip. Pete makes sure you can hear , keeps you safe & even builds in a well timed bathroom break. At the end of the tour he is very happy to recommend his favourite restaurants & bars , provide directions etc. Book Pete’s tour, you’ll have a great time!!!!!", "An excellent walking tour.  Pete is very friendly and helpful. Great knowledge of his town. Would thoroughly recommend!", "Wonderful tour. Lots of interesting sights and history. Well worth it. Especially liked listening to Pete’s intricate knowledge of what’s Saint John was and what it is becoming.", "Friendly, knowledgeable, & fun. We feel this was a great way to experience downtown St. John from a native who was well versed in its history & modernization. Easy walking pace with just a little bit of uphill climb along the way.  Pete spoke in a casual, warm, & loud voice which we appreciated. Frequent stops to savor each spot. Tour lasted approximately 2.5 hours.", "Excellent tour!  Pete is very friendly.  He knows everything about St. John — and seems to know everybody there — and clearly loves the community.  Highly recommended.", "If you are in town, I highly recommend this tour.  Pete's knowledge and passion for the town and its history really shine through!  Our tour ended up running three hours, and we loved all of it.", "Pete was very good! Knew his history, didn’t speak too long at any one place. Walked at a reasonable pace for seniors. Allowed for time to sit and listen to the commentary and a bathroom break. He spoke loud enough for all to hear. Although the tour went past the 1 pm time frame, it was enjoyable and it was definitely comprehensive. Thanks Pete!", "Is it possible to start this tour at an earlier time than 11?  I want to do Pete's on 9/23/25, but I also want to go on an excursion to St. Martin's that begins at 1 p.m.  If we could start the walking tour at 9:30 or 10, I could do both.  If you need a certain number of people to book an earlier tour to make it worth doing, I might be able to manage that as I'm going on this cruise with a big group of people.  I could see who else might be interested.  Please let me know!"], "review_date": ["Written October 11, 2024", "Written October 10, 2024", "Written October 9, 2024", "Written October 8, 2024", "Written September 25, 2024", "Written September 23, 2024", "Written September 22, 2024", "Written September 17, 2024", "Written September 12, 2024", "Written September 12, 2024"]},

Definitely do it, and make it the first thing you do!", "We had an awesome time with Joanna! Joanna was super friendly and incredibly knowledgeable about the surrounding area and all the local businesses.

We saw Orcas and Humpback whales.  We were pleasantly surprised when we found out they take photos so we can focus on the sights and whales.  We even had a water rescue for a purse that went overboard.  So impressive that the captain got us back to where it fell before it sunk and the crew was able to grab it quickly!

Their boat, Marauder, was nice and big and very comfortable. It had lots of seating outside, which was great in the nice weather we had. It also had plenty of seating inside, which I think would be great if it’s windy or raining. Captain Ian and the crew did a great job of finding a variety of wildlife. We saw multiple humpbacks, seal lions, Waldo the sea otter, moon jellyfish, and a ton of different bird life. Service was excellent throughout, with both Katie‘s and Courtney answering all of our questions, and they were all very knowledgeable, personable and friendly. You can tell they love what they do. The toilet on board and the hot drinks where a really nice touch too. Thank you to everyone for an amazing experience, we will be back!", "A few things to be noted. It gets very cold on the boat! Wrap up warm and cover yourself with suntan cream. This tour massively over promised and under delivered. We have been on numerous animal watching excursions across the world and this was probably the poorest. We saw 1 whale from a distance and after about 5 minutes we left. Only then saw sea lions and 1 sea otter. The other issue was that it’s a large group and , in our case, 4 big people hogged the front of the boat obscuring the view for the rest of us and nothing was done. Left after 3 cold hours feeling we had totally wasted our time and money. Would not recommend and would not do again.", "This tour was everything I expected and more.

(We wanted the speed of the fast boat!)They had seen a lot of whales in the morning that day too, so I don't really know if the time of day matters.  Maybe we were just lucky, but we saw many pods.

(Maybe just taking the ferry would have been good enough?)  The \"history\" part of the cruise was just an employee reading a script off their phone into a microphone, and it was quite lame.  The food cost was unexpectedly high and I came in expecting it to be high, and it was so foul and gross I couldn't eat it.  The drinks... well, I'm sure there was some alcohol somewhere in there, but it was basically a glass of weird tasting water.  So... if there is another cheaper/better option, do that instead of this one.", "We arrived a few minutes before the required time for the tour to begin.

I asked for a refund and was told to contact Viator. I reached out to Viator, who also refused the refund. Upon learning they refused to refund the money, I told them I disagreed with the decision and would fight the charge through my credit card company.

There were several school bus loads on the tour, but they were kept on the lower deck, so the rest of us had the upper desk and I was very grateful.

After a break in Niagara on the Lake and a stop at the whirl pool we had a good lunch at the Elements on the Falls restaurant with a view to the horseshoe waterfall. After the lunch we went on the Journey Behind the Falls and finally with the Hornblower boat tour. We saw the falls from a lot of different angles and perspectives during the day and King Tours ensured a minimum of waiting time between the attractions.

She has a set route which includes Peggy’s Cove, so I don’t believe eliminating that is an option. Regarding the ship timing it may be tight.

We booked online several weeks in advance as the tours can sell out quickly. There is an option to book a more expensive ticket where you can reserve a seat. However, bear in mind you are not able to do this until the day when checking in for the flight. We were advised that window seats would offer the best views, so opted for those. The pilot was friendly and gave passengers a brief overview before the flight began. Overall, the experience was quite surreal and exciting. It was really special to view such lovely scenery from above. Personally, I would have enjoyed a little bit of commentary to explain what we were looking at, but I understand why this wouldn’t really be possible due to the pilot’s commitments. Also, the aircraft was very noisy so it would be difficult to hear anyway! Being in the air did make our heads/ears go funny at times, which is to be expected. The experience was quite costly, but as a one-off, we enjoyed flying in a seaplane as it’s something so unique.

After watching the seaplanes take off and land my husband mentioned doing a seaplane flight. We went in and booked for the next day.

After boarding the pilot advised us of our flight plan (flying over the city and then up to Howe Sound and return), then we floated out for take-off. It was a little noisy taking off (we didnt use the provided earplugs), but once we were in the air the views took over. I can not explain what we saw in detail but it was breathtaking, from the City Skyline, Beaches, Mountains, Lakes, then onto Howe Sound where we got to see Islands, snow-capped mountain ranges, frozen lakes and roadways we would drive in a week’s time. There were times it was a little bumpy but again the views were amazing. Our flight was around 45minutes with 35minutes in the air and our landing was very smooth. It is not something I had ever thought of doing (being a nervous flyer on normal planes, the plane being small, landing and taking off on water), but it was as an amazing experience and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.

We were hoping to see maybe 1-2 whales if we’re lucky but this trip completely exceeded our expectations. It only took around 20min until we saw the first whale. The staff was very polite and knowledgeable about the whales and other wildlife around Vancouver so it was interesting to learn about how the animals behave and what the conservationist do to protect them. At one moment, we even saw a group of 5-6 whales together which was so beautiful. We had a fantastic experience and we will definitely go whale watching again in future.", "Alex, Tobin , Yaz, Karl  and Petra were an amazing professional crew. I Attended the Salish Sea Dream Trip on September 6th 2024. We had an amazing day viewing 5 hump back whales showing playful behavior. I loved Christy island and the seals along the shore. The boat is amazing ! super fast but windy. Nice places to sit and lots of room to move around if you want a different view. I found the boat to be clean and stoked. The coffee and tea is a nice touch and tasty.  The front of house staff is great too i believe the names are Ella and Fawkes as i came in on two separate days for assistance. I would say the only feedback is to sell binoculars even cheap semi good ones with some marketing on it. I saw someone with it and thought that was a great idea, maybe even some sweaters,  jackets, beanie,   or blankets.

We learned a lot about the history of glaciers and icefields, how they work together, how they come to be, about their ecosystem, and how they thrive and struggle. Actually getting to walk on the glacier and be up close to the icefield was breathtaking. There is a long hike from the foothill to the actual glacier with a few steep (but short) switchbacks both up and down.

I'm glad we went with this small group tour. It's definitely worth the extra cost. The van can get to places that the big busses can't, and it can move around more easily and quickly. The smaller group allows the feasibility to get out of the vehicle more often to take better pictures. At a couple of stops, we saw big bus tours stop only for a couple minutes for their passengers to take pictures through the dirty windows, while we were able to stop off the van and take better pictures. And speaking of dirty windows (which I read reviews about on some of the big bus tours), the windows on our van were clean and crystal clear. Our tour guide was even cleaning them just before the tour started. We were looking at this 3-hour tour vs the full day tour. Although I'm sure the full day tour would be great for some people, we personally decided that a full day was more time than we really wanted to spend for a tour. This tour covers a lot in 3 hours. The stops were just the right amount of time. Our tour guide Mounir was very knowledgeable and friendly. We really enjoyed this tour and the tour guide, and we strongly recommend it.", "It was a good overall view or perspective of Montreal. Although St. Joseph's Oratory could have been skipped.

We give him the highest rating! the trip took us to parts of the Montreal that made  for a pleasant and comprehensive experience", "This was awesome! Fran was the absolute best tour guide ever. We had only one day to see Montreal and this was packed with history and sights. This tour was great because there were the three of us plus another couple. We got to see both the older and newer areas of Montreal. It’s a great combo of driving around to see sights plus looking at a few areas where we stop plus a couple of tastings. This was at least 6 hours but was the best way to utilize our time to see the most of the city as turned out to be an overview trip for us.  We stopped for lunch in Old Montreal as well as stopped for two tastings. One was at St. Viateur bagels and the other at a shop where we tasted maple syrup. Delicious. Worth your time if your time is limited and a must do if you want to see as much as possible.", "Notre Dame is NOT on the tour if you want to go inside, however, you can as when you stop for lunch in the neighborhood. Unfortunately for us, the people were on strike and we couldn’t get in.", "Highly Recommended!", "Very knowledgeable and fun guide! Great way to cover large parts of the city and see highlights in half a day.", "It's a very basic tour and not worth the high price they are asking for (over 100 USD). I took the 3-hour tour called \"Montreal in a nut shell\". While our guide Fran was very nice and informative, the tour itself was poorly designed so she couldn't really do much to save the situation. Out of the 3 hours, you spend 2 hours in a car just to get to a church through the suburbs, and then you briefly look at a park and get some nice views of the city. Only in the last hour of the trip do you actually get to see a small portion of the city through the car, while Fran provides interesting information. This tour doesn't include Old Montreal or any of the interesting neighborhoods. Calling it \"Montreal in a nut-shell\" is a bit unfair because most of the trip is outside of Montreal and you barely drive through it. Only if you take the full 7 hour tour do you actually see the city, so I would recommend only taking that option. The main problem is the price. It costs 100 US dollars for a 3 hour trip that doesn't include much. Other than that, our guide Fran was very pleasant and thoughtful. But they need to redesign the trip or charge much less for it (or just cancel the half-tour option completely and only do the 7 hour option).", "Had a crappy situation, wherein my connecting flight got rescheduled to 24 hours later. Decided to see Montreal as I had enough time- was probably the best decision I had made. The tour was amazing! The guide went above and beyond to show us what Montreal is all about.", "Our guide Mounir was excellent!  He picked up our group of 5 in a very comfortable SUV for our 3 hour tour.  He was well informed, interesting, and friendly.  He drove us around the different areas of the city, which he knows very well.  The tour included a visit to L'Oratoire Saint-Joseph, which was beautiful and very moving.  The highlight for our college aged sons was driving onto the Formula 1 track (although at a much slower speed!)  I would highly recommend Mounir and this tour especially if you are only in the city a couple of days.", "Will this tour be in English?

Tall water falls but you could spend a half day to see it all.  Back on the bus to upper Quebec City.   Its a wonderful old European feel City.   Back into the walled city.  We had a couple hours to do our own walk around.    A place to grab some poutine  and a local beer.Then the long trip home.

I learned a lot about trees and he was great at answering all the questions. 10/10", "The ancient tree tour was absolutely fantastic! For those visiting Vancouver, but especially those living in the city — it was eye opening to learn about the incredible resiliency of the ancient trees.", "Colin was very knowledgeable, down to earth and passionate about his line of work, which really came through.

A hidden gem of Vancouver. Thoroughly enjoyed the three hours.", "We had a great time on the tour - it really flew by, and we learned so much about trees and natural history, as well as the cultural and social history of Stanley Park and Vancouver. Colin was a friendly, informative guide and a great storyteller - we saw a whole different side of Vancouver and learned why protecting their ancient trees is so important. Really recommend!", "My partner and I came upon the Ancient Trees of Vancouver Walking Tour quite by chance – on Instagram, of all places. Being lovers of the outdoors, and always open to enjoying some forest therapy, we decided to check this tour out. Like so many reviews before this one, we were not disappointed! Colin Spratt, the creator of the tour and our knowledgeable guide, masterfully combined history, ecology, botany, anthropology, environmentalism, and his own love of the forest to weave a fascinating tale that takes the avid listener from pre-colonial times to the present. In doing so, Colin helps you gain an even greater appreciation for the forest, its old growth giants, and why they remain so important for us and our own survival. The best part? All of this information is presented in a form that’s easily digestible – like having a casual conversation – as you stroll through Stanley Park looking at old maps, historic photos and, of course, the ancient trees you’ve come to see. It takes a special person to convey such information in a way that is appealing and understandable to all over the course of 3+ hours, and Colin does this with ease.", "I don’t want to spoil too much of the tour; so, I’ll only mention a few highlights that really caught my attention: First, the meeting place near Third Beach. It’s a little out of the way, but the choice is deliberate. Yes, you can use the washroom and get some snacks, but there’s also a giant – right here – that often gets overlooked: The largest known alder tree in BC. While not as impressive as giant cedars or douglas firs, the alder is noteworthy for its species. Second, Stanley Park’s famed “Hollow Tree” (see my earlier review on this site). It is, as Colin says, the most “touristy” part of the experience, but people still love to see it. Third, Canada’s largest known Maple tree – such an impressive sight and really helps to put everything into perspective. To quote an earlier review, these trees are “awe-inspiring.”", "In short, the tour is one that every visitor should add to their itinerary. You’ll learn a lot; you’ll get to walk amongst old growth giants; and, you can smile knowing you’re contributing to a worthwhile cause because a portion of ticket sales go towards tree conservation. Thank you!", "What an amazing time we had with Colin! So knowledgeable, entertaining and interesting. The trees are truly spectacular; very humbling when you get to touch something so ancient, that has lived through so much history. The morning just flew by and we could have listened for many more hours.", "Thank you, Colin for your passion and dedication to these magnificent trees.", "The Mitchell family.", "It was one of the best tour we ever had. He is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about this topic and his 3 hours tour and presentation didn’t make us board  at all instead I felt inspired at the end of the tour. He answered all our cultural and scientific questions.", "Thank you and good luck!", "I learned so much on this tour! Colin is truly passionate about what he does and his broad range of knowledge shows. He taught us about the origins of Vancouver and how it directly led to the current state of the remaining trees, as well as showing us some pretty amazing parts of Stanley Park that most people don't bother going to.

Colin was an excellent guide and extremely knowledgable.  He is a forestry professional, who does guided tours - rather than a professional tour guide - so you get much more information about the  trees and the history of the forest in Stanley Park.  The walk takes you up close to amazing trees, some are off the main tracks which you would never find on your own.  He explains their ages, heights, types and history of the trees and other interesting facts about how the First Nations people used to use them.

It was a really memorable experience for us.", "What a privilege to attend this tour and experience Colin's wealth of knowledge on these ancient and majestic beauties. I have always loved and admired trees but now have an even greater appreciation and respect for them.

We appreciate you staying late to answer our questions and educate us. It was a real pleasure.

I almost don't want to write about it as it's Vancouver's Best Kept Secret.  Colin is AMAZING in his knowledge and delivery.  He knows ALL the spots with the most incredible trees...the history and current state of affairs in regard to the forests is his specialty.   The walk itself was excellent as well..I'd recommend hiking boots for a little extra comfort.  The time seriously FLEW by and before we knew it, we were done! I could have appreciated more trees for more hours!  Colin is an excellent guide..answered all of our questions and explained in language we could all understand.  Hemlocks, cedars, maples and spruces, and one super special fir at the very end have been growing here for hundreds and in some cases thousands of years!!  Take this tour to find out more about them and see them up close.  This tour was the highlight of our stay in Vancouver...make it yours as well!!  Well done Colin!", "This exceeded all expectations. It was both educational and a great experience in nature. Our guide was Colin, a tree conservationist, and not only was his knowledge exceptional, but more importantly he was a great communicator and very friendly. We had a group of about ten. I learned way more than I expected and got a great walk in for the morning. This was well worth the price of the tour, and I would easily recommend if you like being outside, talking walks, and want to learn about the ancient trees in Vancouver's Stanley Park.

You can use restrooms, change, have coffee and eat at the center. No, there is no restroom, shade or any thing on the glacier!", "Bring your waterproof hiking boots as you will be walking on rocks, stone, mud/ice snow and even water, while the walk itself is not flat, it is quite easy.

And of course, ice crampons for your shoes.", "I got lucky and the weather was good, but it was very windy so we were all bundled up You do not feel the time pass. I had a great time with the small group. You can really feel the glacier and it’s an amazing experience.", "Highly recommended", "We felt safe the whole time and learned so much from our 3-hour guided hike. It wasn’t even extremely cold up there in June, ranged from 0 to 5 degrees Celsius.", "This was a quality experience from start to finish!  Kelly, our guide, was friendly, helpful, and very knowledgeable.  We could tell that safety was a high priority and she really wanted us to have a great day - which we did!  IceWalks was very well prepared with gear - (we couldn't bring our hiking poles because of limited luggage space so we REALLY appreciated having those!)  IceWalks even had extra clothes (which we didn't need but it was good that this was available).  Kelly gave us plenty of opportunities to get some really great pictures as well as teach us lots of great information about the Athabasca Glacier.  I would highly recommend this Guided Glacier hike!", "Hi,  does this tour include descending into the crevasses?", "Is there a website for the company that does this tour?", "Hi, when I check availability for a July date, it shows both 10am and 2pm options but text says one option available.  Are there tours at both times or only at 10am? Thanks!", "How physically intense is this hike? I'm thinking of bringing my two parents (mid 60s) who are both still active and mobile.\n\nAs a comparison, they were able to do the Lake Louise to the Lake Agnes teahouse hike in 2 hours. Thanks!", "I would say it is an easy to mild walk, only a bit hike at the beginning before getting the ice.  In our group, most of the people are in their 50-60's.  We had so many breaks with the walk was slow.  It was cold at the bottom, but warm and no wind on the mid-end of the glacier. I am sure you and your parents will enjoy the trip.

A local musical comedy theatre production of an excellent standard. Engaging, funny & top quality. The dinner is basic but good. We walked from our hotel - Marriott on Kent Street.

But luckily for my Ottawan friend (who had never been) and I (who said hey we should do this, she looked at me like, are you kidding me) but she relented and came with me and we both really enjoyed it.

We took the small group tour to see Lake Louise and Moraine Lake.  The group size was approximately 10 people and the van was very comfortable.  Nathan, our tour guide, was exceptional.  He was very informative pointing out trivia and landmarks along the way.  He truly made our visit to these beautiful lakes a memorable experience.  He was also very accommodating to our parents.  Thank you!!", "Overall, the experience was very enjoyable. Our driver/tour guide Natasha was very accommodating and knowledgeable. She thoroughly explained ways to get the most out of the somewhat limited time we had at each location. I wholeheartedly recommend this tour to others wishing to visit Moraine Lake and Lake Louise.", "Inha was a great guide, she shared so much great information and insights to the area. Our family had a great time exploring these amazing lakes and Banff highlights. We liked the small group experience a lot.", "My wife and I stayed at the lodge. We had a room with a spectacular view. The room was very posh and very clean. It was large and had a chair and footstool. The bed was very comfortable. Temperature control was perfect. There was a gas log fireplace for ambiance. The staff were super helpful. The price for the room was high at $1500 per night but worth every penny.", "We enjoyed our journey to Moraine Lake, Lake Louise, and Banff Secrets.  Cam was an excellent tour guide with good knowledge and organisation, so we saw both Lakes at their best.  We loved that it was a small bus group.", "We would recommend this tour.", "Our guide Jess was great. She really did a good job of tailoring it to what we wanted to see. She provided tips to get away from the crowds at busy spots and took us to unknown areas we would never have seen. Definitely the easiest way to see Moraine and Louise - which are often so crowded.", "Nolan fro Radventures was an incredibly knowledgeable guide. He shared a wealth of information with us during our ride to our tour site, as well as on our tour. He is the quintessential  professional , making our tour a positive and enjoyable experience. Thanks Nolan you are a gem!", "This was the full day tour beginning with pickup at 7:30am returning around 3:30pm. We had a wonderful day with Latashya -- prompt arrival at our hotel, really friendly and knowledgeable, itinerary was well planned (Lake Louise > Moraine Lake > the scenic 1A > Mt. Norquay), included a delicious lunch (we ordered during the reservation process), ... and gorgeous weather to boot! The full day allowed for 2 hours at each Lake Louise and Moraine Lake (noting Moraine is only accessible by shuttle so getting to see from this tour is a great option) -- which felt like a great amount of time to soak in the sites from each. At Lake Louise we had time to walk to the back of the lake to walk on the clay and then up to Fairview Lookout to see it from elevation (colors are incredible!). And at Moraine Lake, that left us enough time to walk up the Rockpile Trail as well as around the lakefront trail. Latashya then drove us down scenic 1A (the original highway) and we stopped at several lookouts including Mount Norquay which provides an incredible perch to see the town of Banff. If you're looking for a great day to see the highlights in Banff, we'd highly recommend ts full day tour from Radventures! 10/10 and then some.", "This tour was just perfect.  A smaller bus meant we could really get to know the other people on board.   The pick up at the train station was easy and we got underway on time.    Our tourguide was a young woman from Britain who was deligtful.   She had great knowledge and talked just enough without being annoyed.  We visited all the key sites and had plenty of time to hike around.", "We had a great day.  Took a lifetime memories .

The actual audio itself was entertaining and educational! We enjoyed the trivia at each stop as well. We went to Lake Louise the next day and this part of the tour is also included as it is the same tour.

Expensive for what you actually get."], "review_description": ["The waterfalls are stunning, but there were several issues that made the tour fall short of expectations. First, 40 minutes before they were supposed to pick us up at the hotel, we were informed they couldn’t come because of “road closures” in Toronto. We were asked to take a taxi to another hotel where they would be waiting for us, and they assured us they would cover the cost of the Uber. However, when we arrived at the other hotel, there were no road closures in sight, which made it seem like they simply didn’t pick us up because it was inconvenient for them.", "While they did reimburse the Uber cost, we had to spend extra time commuting, which was not what we signed up for. To get the refund, they said the driver would reimburse us in cash. I had to ask him multiple times, and only at the very end of the trip (when he was about to drop us back at the hotel) did he reluctantly give us the money back.", "Speaking of money, I still don’t understand the tour’s cost. It seemed very high for what we received. We spent hours on the road making stops that didn’t make much sense. The driver was rushed and occasionally rude.", "In summary, I wouldn’t recommend this tour based on its cost-benefit ratio.", "The company did not pick us up from the hotel as per the agreement. We had to reach a new place to board. Our phone calls were never returned .There were no restrooms in the bus which was agreed on. The vehicle was quite shabby and dirty. The driver took 10 stops for pickups which made the trip travel time to 3 hrs instead of 1.5 hrs. Will not recommend anyone to use zoom travel.", "This experience was absolutely amazing!!! It was too good that I had to do a review. The shuttle had spots that they would pick up and it was nice that they waited for those that missed it the first time. The bus ride didn’t seem that long. The tour guide/ driver was very knowledgeable and funny. The boat ride to see it up close was beautiful and absolutely breathtaking. The views from the hotel dinner was the perfect location to see the view. Maple syrup tasting was a cool new experience. The buffet was good, plenty of options. Seeing the Niagara Falls at night was a totally different experience. Highly recommend this tour to everyone! Worth it!", "We got a little worried when we read the odd poor review.

He was our tour guide and he was absolutely fantastic. Involved the group, made everyone welcome and cracked one liners all trip. He’s obviously a clever guy because he had all the info too. I can honestly say he made the trip for us.", "That said the stops were really interesting and the falls were amazing for us as first time visitors. We also booked the dinner at the Sheraton.

We requested a hotel pickup but were told after the fact where we had to meet the bus.  This required an uber ride to a coffee shop downtown.  Traffic in downtown Toronto is the worst I have ever experienced.  The Boat ride was the highlight but the other stops did not offer much.  Better off just booking the boat ride on your own.  We opted for the optional buffet at the Sheraton.  It was a nice buffet but not sure it was worth $50 per person.  The tables they have set aside for the tour group did not offer a view of the falls.  We did not make it back to the pickup point until after midnight then had to wait for a ride back to the hotel.", "Booked trip with my family. Bus came on time at 12:45 for pick up, but took 2h to get all guests on the board. There was a bit traffic,  so, we took back route, which was ok. Due to festival we didn't stop in village on the Lake. We arrived to Niagary at 7pm, so, took 6hours to come there!We had Stops on the way, but not enough time to explore- always 10min or 20min(once). Our guide Anthony was knowledgeable and great, can't fault him. Boat trip was great, had 2h of free time. Can't comment on dinner as didn't have it. Travel back to hotel took 2.5h", "A terrific tour by day and night to Niagara Falls and the region around. Johnny, our tour guide, was fun and knowledgeable, sharing a lot of stories along the way. We passed through different areas of the Niagara region, including vineyards, a small chapel, and going through Niagara-on-the-Lake, first stopping for a brief view of the Niagara river, with the US on the other side and the opening to Lake Ontario, and then a 40 minute break in town for a brief stroll on the main street, including a stop for Ice Cream, admiring all the nice buildings and flowers and some souvenir watching. The final stop at Niagara Falls was all that was advertised. The Hornblower ride was quick to get on and then the ride into the falls is marvelous. We ended up adding the buffet dinner at the Sheraton in the end and didn't regret it. The views to the falls and city from the balcony are great. The food choice was nice, and saves you time. A brief stroll through the center, including the crazy Clifton Hill ('Las Vegas' is more and more inflated with extravagance) before the night show (glowing falls and a bit of fireworks) and heading back to Toronto.", "Unfortunately due to bad planning on the tour operators behalf this day was spoilt.

What I don't understand is why if you are aware that it will be a busy day did the company not plan for this, setting off earlier or even better not to take bookings on what I can only think is one of the busier days of the year!", "Ali our driver, tried his best to keep our spirits up an was informative but after hours of detouring, picking people up, changing buses, traffic, and having to drive past places on the itinerary and not getting to enjoy it, everyone on board was extremely deflated.", "We stopped at a few locations and was given 3-5 mins max to jump out , get a picture and return to the bus.

Yet he refused to give us the wifi password.", "I read reviews that people have gotten free maple syrup testing so I was excited for that but we did not get this.", "On our way he kept saying \"so I've drove a lot of famous people but I chase the money & don't get it but don't chase the famous people cause I don't care, & they come to me\" or something like this, yet he kept name dropping celebrities he's drove for, so for someone who \"doesn't care\" he sure talked about it a lot.", "We were told specific times to be back at the bus for the certain sights. Once we had maybe 15 minutes & yet these people decide to be 6 minutes late. I don't know why we didn't just leave if they couldn't respect the times given when he told us multiple times to be on time.", "We were given about an hour to go view the falls before the boat, & he refers to the falls as \"the stupid falls\" i was very upset by this bc you are dissing one of the wonders of the world & we paid money to see this, as a guide you should be positive about the sight not saying negative things. Syed didn't bother walking around with us either. He continually told us \"no snacking or eating because the meal is a buffet and anything you don't eat is served the next day\"", "He then asked who was all going to the dinner, & I felt very singled out when I didn't raise my hand & he said to me \"why not it's only 60$\" like he just wanted more of my money. I would rather go explore, & I have allergies so it was safer for me not to. He also told the people for supper \"tell them your with zoom tours not me, I have a bad rep with them\"", "As this was an evening tour I was under the impression we would be taking the boat tour when the falls were light up and for the fireworks but this was not the case.", "Syed recommend a spot to stand to view the light show and fireworks up higher on a platform close to the hotel the guests were having dinner at. He told us \"oh if you don't stand here you will regret it\" I had made my way over there thinking this would be good and stood in the corner. Well part of the falls were blocked off by the info center building, & the part you could see had all the light posts on the edge of the sidewalk so trying to get pics they showed up.I felt so far away. I ignored his suggestion, & go down to the barricade where there wasn't as much of a crowd, & I loved that the view was so much closer. Then he asked where I stoo once I got back I told him I didn't like the view up higher & he almost seemed annoyed I didn't listen.", "Before we went on the hornblower, we were told to meet at 10:10. He said there will be an alarm at 9:50, to give a 10 minute warning, & its only a 5 minute show & to meet at 10:10. I see it is 10:05 & the fireworks werent done yet, but I didn't want to be late and him take off. so I rush over to where & bus was parked I got there at 10:09 missing some of the fireworks in order to arrive at the bus on time. He tells us 10:10 yet we didn't even leave until after 10:20 because some people decided to not show up on time. so it would have been nice giving us a time after the fireworks and enough time to walk back to see the whole show.", "I felt off when I got to the bus he said \"oh give me a review now so you don't forget\" yet our tour wasn't done yet as we still had to get back to Toronto. Then on our way back he tells us \"oh the tours over now\" & got no info. Now he offers the wifi in order to do the review. While waiting I had seen reviews about certain guides with this company begging for tips after they got dropped off & that's when I noticed he had a paper saying \"please tip 15-20% of the price you paid for our service\" there were reviews of people saying they would stand infront of you while trying to get off the bus, and trying to intimidate you or beg you for the tips. one of these reviews mentioned a guide who was referring to the falls as the \"stupid falls\" so I was like oh great this is him and this is last thing I need is to be hounded to give a tip.", "I had watched what he was doing while dropping people off in downtown toronto. He would get off the bus. Hold out his hand to help the guest down but was standing infront of them blocking them off and asking for a tip. He would continue trying to beg them until they gave in. Yes he did give us some information, but for any of the stops and even at niagara he didn't stay with us at all other than on the bus & to be late picking up after being told to be 15 minutes early. Just didn't feel like his service was great. Also I am against people begging for tips. If your service is good people will tip. You should not need to rely on begging guests for the tips. also the booking said tips were optional.", "I came up with a plan to avoid this, and when he held his hand out I did a quick jump to his side so I could get infront of him and create some space so he couldn't box me in & I said thank you and hurried off. He then called out to me and said \"no tip?\" and I told him \"sorry I don't have any cash on me\". I feel like if I didn't see these reviews I would have been one of them  trapped & I really wasn't carrying any $ on me so i was glad I prepared for getting out of that situation.", "I chose not to tip as well after the fact I seen the pricing for the hornblower it was only like 30$ (approx). I paid 200$ with tax, and I assumed that the stops we made along the way for the smallest chappal, flower clock and whirlpool were all paid activitys. I seen you could pay $ if you wanted to be on the boat during the light show, & i would have paid extra for this & wish I had the option. he was no where in sight to ask if we could chose to pay for this and still be able to make the bus, so i had to miss this. He offered a helicopter ride that wasnt even operating bc of the weather, so i dont get why he wouldnt offer this. I understand some of that $ would go to fuel, and some to pay for the wages, but for what I had gotten I could have done that all myself on my own if I was more comfortable driving in bigger cities. So he took the downtown people first, & this is when I noticed him honking his horn a lot. I thought that was quite unnecessary  He atold me \"oh your hotels too far I'll take you to the airport\" it was already about midnight and I'm thinking great, we won't get there till 1230 am, and I still have to call my shuttle which could take an extra 40 mins and another 12 minute drive so I'd be back closer to 130 am. In the tour info it showed this tour was 8-9 hours. I booked the 1 pm tour so the tour should have been finished by 9 pm then & us dropped off at the hotel. that's an extra 3.5 hours I wasn't expecting to arrive back that late when I had to be up at 6 am.", "Seeing the falls though was incredible, the boat tour and light show was amazing. I'm happy I went with my instincts and chose to go down lower because I felt like it was a better view.", "I just don't appreciate being told to arrive early, yet you can not do the same when I already had to go out of my way to get to a spot to meet after thinking for months I'd be picked up at the hotel. I also don't appreciate people begging for tips. That makes me 100% not want to.", "The trip started off terrible. The driver showed up 45 minutes late, in a bus that had the check engine light on, the door didn’t close all the way, and stalled in the middle of the road. We had to stop to switch out buses at the airport. He then was on the phone with someone arguing about having two empty seats on his bus. So we had to make another stop to pick up more people. So we didn’t even get out to Niagara until 530pm. The whole trip was rushed, we didn’t get any time at all to enjoy the viewpoints or scenery. We were instructed to get off the bus, take a photo, and get back on. We finally get out there to get on our boat, and he had us literally running through the streets to get to the boat tour. No time to enjoy anything. The itinerary says they are skip the line entries- they were not. The boat trip itself was pretty cool. But again, we were rushed from the boat tour to dinner, because he told us the food was closed at 9pm. So again, no time to enjoy the falls. The dinner was really good, great selection and good food, however, we did not get to pick our own table, we had to sit at the same table as the whole bus, and we definitely did not have a view of the falls from our table. The itinerary also said we got free time to explore Niagara, we had none of that. It was super disappointing, especially since we paid so much for the experience. We really didn’t get to experience much of what was listed in the description.", "He told us many times that traffic was always this bad and that we picked the worst time of the year to do this activity. If this is normal traffic, why did he not plan accordingly to pick us up on time? Or the company plan the trip pickup time for an earlier time to make up for time spent in traffic? Or even offer a discounted rate for the busier time of the year?", "I wouldn’t recommend this company at all.

No one can help the weather but this is more about appropriate preparation. I checked  after the tour and couldn't find any reference as to what to wear. I think we were falsely reassured by seeing survival suits were provided. They are not water proof so on a wet cold day the water soaks through to your undies relatively quickly. Also with about 6 degrees ambient and raining, real temp is below zero. So woolen gloves when wet no good and you need water proof shoes. Being cold for a bit is fine, but wet and cold down to underwear and numb hands and feet does diminish the enjoyment when temp is so low. I think either water proof gear should be provided, or there should be clear instructions about what to wear on the day. Most people I suspect will assume a survival suit will keep them warm and dry mostly, which it doesn't. The guide was fantastic given the conditions and this is no reflection on her.

Great guide in Senan!"], "review_description": ["We booked this tour, knowing it would be a 12 hour day. The bus picked us up at our hotel (the Sutton Park) at 09.00 (exactly as stated on our booking). The guide introduced himself (Justin) and explained the itinerary for the day and the importance of timekeeping as we were booked on specifically ferries to and from the island. Justin provided a running commentary of very interesting facts as we passed locations. Justin gave us sufficient time at both Butchart gardens and the town of Victoria. The gardens were amazing (helped by the weather being warm and sunny). Justin made the whole tour fantastic. It did not feel like a 12 hour tour.", "One of the best excursions I have been on! Our guide and driver, Dan, was great! So interesting and informative, gave good recommendations too! Yes, it is a long trip, but one I would do again. Butchart Gardens is truly breathtaking and definitely a must see! Dan kept us informed of what was coming up so we didn't miss anything along the way.", "This tour was amazing and both of us would unconditionally recommend it if the guide was as good as ours - Justin from Whistler. This tour was chosen based on past recommendations, because it provided a timed itinerary and that the tour company was recognised as a local bus operator.", "However it was our tour guide Justin that made our day memorable. His commentary was extremely informative and covered everything from climate to local customs and cultures, including several amusing facts. We felt like we were friends by the end of the tour and he really did make a difference - his driving was excellent.", "It was a memorable day where we could relax .", "Thankyou.", "Janice Zaharko (Resident) & Sharon Johns ( visitor from New Zealand)", "A great day out on the coach with driver and tour guide Justin. He was perfect for the job; very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. The coach itself was comfortable and not crowded. The ferry to and from Vancouver Island provides some good views of the Gulf islands. The gardens are scenic and photogenic. Victoria was worth a visit although not the highlight of the trip.", "An early start today as we were picked up by a tour guide for our day trip to Vancouver Island. The coach ride down to the ferry port was really interesting as we had a full commentary. We have, again, been blessed by beautiful weather so the crossing was fabulous, with the ferry weaving through the Gulf Islands in the Straits of Georgia. We then headed to Butchard Gardens, 55 acres of privately owned gardens on the south of Vancouver Island. The close proximity to the mountains in north USA means the south of Vancouver Island has a Mediterranean micro-climate and therefore the gardens are able to grow a wide range of plants. We really enjoyed walking round the gardens including the sunken garden, the Japanese garden and the Italian garden, all beautifully maintained by over 70 gardeners. We found a quiet bench with a view to have a picnic lunch. This afternoon we went to the state capital Victoria. With a beautiful inland harbour it had an exclusive air, with lots of big yachts. We walked over to see the Legislature, their impressive parliament building. Then had a walk around the harbour and down the main shopping street. The harbour is dominated by the enormous Fairmont Empress Hotel, so a cocktail on the terrace seemed in order…….. it would have been rude not to . Our ferry back was sadly mainly in the dark and arriving back at our hotel at 9.30pm made it a 13 hour day but it has definitely been worth it . You mention Vancouver to anyone who has been here and they always say you must visit Vancouver Island….. they were right!", "Special mention to our driver/ guide Dan who was professional calm funny and informative", "Every stop was well explained and timings clarified. He also gave top tips for how to approach the sights to the best use of time such as buying a sandwich on the ferry to eat at Butchart to have more time in the gardens which side of the ferry to sit and where to get food and drink in Victoria. Really appreciate his style!", "Never expected to see what awaited us. Spectacular. So much work and effort to make the experience so beautiful and memorable", "This is a long day but definitely worth the effort, well organised, lots of really useful information.", "Justin was great, friendly and well organised.", "The gardens are beautiful, Victoria was lovely, the ferry across and back is also a wonderful part of the day.", "Beautiful gardens.

As a third generation gardener, I have been to many gardens over my lifetime.  I have completed gardening programs at the New York Botanical Garden and been a member of the NYBG as well as the Biltmore Estate in Asheville NC.

The same with the bus tour to the gardens.  The gardens were gorgeous!!", "This was an amazing trip that was accomplished easily!  I didn't have to worry about making connections and had plenty of time to do all I wanted.  The Gardens were FABULOUS, and after touring them I enjoyed Tea there - delicious!  The bus driver was terrific and shared a lot of local knowledge.  He really elevated the trip and I was lucky to have him both directions.  The flight was good and made good use of my time.

Justin was an excellent driver and partial tour guide.  Everything ran as expected except traffic getting to Victoria from the Gardens.

Seeing the Falls both during the day and lit up at night was a real treat. Our guide, Glenda, was excellent!! So very friendly and helpful, juggling multiple parties with different activities. We signed up for all the extras and don’t regret them at all. Seeing behind the Falls is pretty spectacular, and you really get a sense of the power of the Falls when you’re on the Hornblower cruise. Dinner at Table Rock restaurant overlooking the Falls was better than I expected. The food was quite good and the view can’t be beat! And the dinner package included the Illumination Tower experience. I feared it would be gimmicky, but it was our favorite part. We met Bill, who’s been changing the lights for years.

A little stop at a rest area for a bathroom break and a coffee. Then onto Niagara Falls where we enjoyed syrup & fudge tasting & also stopped at a look out on the river. At the falls, Adam easily got us into the Behind the Falls activity which was so cool. This activity takes you to the bottom of the falls where we could feel the mist of the water. Two look out spots are actually under the falls and we could see the water crashing down. Once back above ground we had time to view the falls and take more photos.", "Next we went up the Skylon Tower to view the falls from 200 ft up!

After supper we took the bus to illumination tower a gentleman explained how the falls are lit up at night and we changed the colours of the falls ourselves! After a full day, we all sat back and relaxed while Adam got us back to Toronto safely. I cant say enough about this tour, Adam was professional and seems to care about his guests.

If you select the dinner option, there is a prix fixe dinner at the restaurant directly overlooking the falls.

He was concerned that other tourists are waiting and it was not my mistake he missed the stop. Then I finally boarded the bus and I did not enjoy any part of the travel. The mic was not working and any detail he shared was not clear.

Our cruise ship docked at Sydney offered shore excursions but I wanted something more intimate. There was a bit of confusion when we arrived but the Taxi company quickly arranged a car and tour guide/driver to pick us up. (They had several vehicles standing by.)

We wanted to continue the tour, Ari our guide suggested another route including lunch and Alexander G Bell museum.", "We had the best chowder ever at The Freight Shed. It was at a scenic Beddeck fishing village. Ari was informative. His love for the island was evident. He took great care of us. 7 hours just flew by, we had so much fun and good grub.  It richly enhanced our cruise experience. Highly recommend getting a private tour with the company and driver.", "Regrettably we did have a poor experience. The drivers were waiting right outside the cruise ship walkway and found us right away, which was a great start!  However, from that point forward, the trip did not go well. The trip scheduled to start at 8:30 for four in a tax did not start until 9:00 because they were searching for another couple to add onto our trip. We had a very friendly driver but six of us were uncomfortably put into the car. which made the whole trip difficult from the start. The second important reason for the low rating is that this is not a tour but simply a taxi service. You are driven to the destination and the left to tour it on your own! The fort is beautiful and worth seeing and we were given sufficient time to see it, but Mira National Park was a disappointment because after seeing the Lighthouse, our driver only stopped by the Mira River Bridge but nowhere else in the beautiful park. The trip was sold to us as going from 8:30 to 2:00, but the trip started at 9:00 am and ended by 1:00pm. Despite having a decent driver who felt bad for our situation, it did not change the experience. It was our first booking with Viator and we were sincerely disappointed.", "This was a quick way to tour the area and see the Louisbourg fortress and lighthouse.

We had to ask what the problem was/what he meant, he said the tower and behind the falls had no power.

Here is the real kick in the teeth, however, they only provided a refund of £37 once we were back home in England!  Yes, that is correct, we ended up paying £223 for two of us to only go onto the boat at the falls with a short ride in the mini bus, plus being dropped off at the bus depot, a 5 minute drive.  Upon contacting See Sight via their online chat (they didn't reply to our email nor answer the phone/return our call after we left a message), we were told the appropriate refund had been made.

Our driver was very nice and the Niagara Falls boat ride was the highlight, but 3 hours to get to the falls was not what was advertised.

Our guide did an excellent job of getting us as far as he could in the allotted time frame. I SO wish we could have gone the entire loop of the Cabot Trail as we thoroughly enjoyed the sights and history of what we were able to see In our limited time. In returning to the ship, it's too bad we had to simply retrace our steps, re-seeing the sights we had already driven past and not new sights all the way back to the ship. We especially liked the stop at a fishing port and watching the fisherman deliver their lobsters to waiting buyers, seeing the creatures up close and seeing how the whole system works!", "I sent several emails to inquire about planning the Mini-Cabot Trail Tour in at the end of July 2024.

I couldn't have asked for a better time. Kevin was excellent in making sure I was able to get a trip in before leaving, and having a chance to paddle around the harbour and learn more about the area from the excellent guide (whose name I forgot, I'm so sorry, but she was excellent!!) really made the experience even better. I would absolutely book with them again next time I'm back as some of the other tours they offer sound really incredible, and getting a chance to do them with some locals who are familiar with the area and its history adds so much. I would definitely recommend them.", "Fantastic morning spent with our lovely and very knowledgeable guide Sam, kayaking around the harbour at Ucluelet.

Sam was a terrific, personal guide and spent time pointing out wildlife and sharing her in-depth knowledge of the area. Truly enjoyed this excursion and would recommend.  Will likely plan to come back and do a longer tour in the future.", "We booked the Harbour kayak tour one day before. Shortly after we came to the harbour our guide Emma arrived, and we were surprised, that it was only us two to take part in the tour.

Thanks once again for this beautiful experience!!!", "Susanne and Matthias from Germany", "Excellent value for money. Our knowledgeable guide educated us with local history as we paddled through the Ucluelet inlet.

But the team and crew put us to ease very quickly, got us comfortable with the suits and safety, and had us on our way quickly.  The open boat experience was amazing.  Gave you the true experience of being in the environment but yet felt completely comfortable. We could not believe the number of humpbacks that we saw, including a male/female pair and a mother w/calf, several others at a distance.  And to top it off we saw a brother/sister pair of orcas.  The naturalist, Val, was incredibly knowledgable and ensured that we were both safe and getting the most out of the experience.  Captain Rodrigo had a talent for getting and keeping us in the right place while maintaining protocols.", "We came away with this amazing experience while also feeling like our presence was not disturbing these awesome animals.  Strong work, Vancouver Island Whale Watch!", "This was a fantastic and exhilarating trip out with Captain Dave and Hayleigh! We felt so lucky to see so many humpback whales. Hayleigh shared so much knowledge about their behaviour as well as the other wildlife we saw like the sea lions and turkey vultures. We would absolutely recommend doing this trip!", "We had a fantastic experience visiting the humpback whales in what they described as a whale soup, there were so many of the fantastic beasts", "Went with my Dad , who also ALWAYS wanted to do this . We had a great time . Saw many humpbacks , Was very cool and magical for sure . Did not see orcas , wich was disappointing , but no ones fault of course . But it was a great experience for sure . Saw many seals and sealions , some with babys . Also saw the Gabriola Bluffs , wich ive never seen before . It was amazing . So glad we did this , and Ill take my Hubby and Grandson soon as well . 5 star experience ! Staff was wonderful and very inviting and warm.", "This is absolutely worth signing up for! We were a bit doubtful about the exposure suits to start with on a hot day, but grateful for them in an open boat doing 50km/hr+. The guides were really knowledgeable, and safety was clearly a priority so that we all felt very safe.  It’s a beautiful location to spend a morning out on the water even without any company, but we were blessed with fabulous weather and a couple of playful hump backs who came to visit within touching distance of our boat (although of course, no touching allowed!).  We saw 5 whales in total plus many grumpy sea lions, seals, cormorants, a bald eagle and a couple of hungry vultures.  Definitely would recommend - even our teenage son said it was lots of fun!", "Hailey, our guide, and Sylvan, our Captain were amazing! They found the humpback whales and when the first one wasn’t very active they found us another set of whales and they were stunning. Then we were on our way back quickly moving through the water and somehow they spotted another one who breached right in front of us. It was a once in a lifetime experience and the zodiac style boat was so fun. My son enjoyed the boat so much he said he didn’t care if he saw a whale because he was so happy with the boat ride in itself. Thank you Haley and Sylvan!", "First trip out on the water during our trip of a lifetime to Vancouver Island - and a great choice to go with these guys. Saw lots of wildlife including humpbacks, supported by friendly, knowledgeable guides. And even though we had to wear the big survival suits required on an open boat on one of the hottest days of the year (!!!!), the trip out was comfortable and fun.", "I'm confused about the time scheduling.

Well worth the price for a good day in Novia Scotia.", "This had to be one of the best excursions we’ve ever had. As any excursion goes you never know what to expect and usually you cross your fingers hoping that’ll be good.", "Paul was amazing, from the moment I booked the excursion until the moment he dropped us off back at the port. Paul was early to pick us up which gave us the advantage of being early at Peggy’s cove. His mission was to get us there before all the other tour buses and that he did given us the opportunity to enjoy it without crowds. Paul also took the scenic route instead of the highway so that we had the chance to admire the beautiful scenery, slowing down for us to be able to take pictures and stopping at small places that were interesting like a lobster place where we received a lesson on the different types of lobsters very interesting 😊 Paul drove us around Lunenburg pointing out so many interesting details. Overall it was a great experience Paul was definitely a 10 out 10 highly recommended.", "Read the excellent reviews and went to Paul’s website after not being impressed by the cruise line’s offerings or prices for excursions on the day we were in Halifax. We were initially interested in his Titanic tour so I inquired and received a response in less than 24 hours. While he wasn’t offering it on that particular day, he offered us spots on the South Shore one. What an awesome stroke of luck we didn’t even realize had occurred! Paul confirmed our reservation via email with detailed instructions for pick-up when we arrived in port, and followed up with a text to make sure I received them. All very reassuring.", "Paul’s tour is top notch! A must do for anyone visiting Halifax. First, it’s a van vs. a bus, so easier to get around city streets and small town roads. He knows his way around traffic! The small group size also allowed for us to take as much time as we wanted or even cut short allotted time at each stop. Paul drove us along the scenic coast and waterways for a perfectly picturesque ride. (The big buses took the highway.)", "Along with the major stops, we made a couple of “off the beaten path” ones that truly make this a unique experience. Like a little beach area with white sand and turquoise water….on the South Shore of Nova Scotia! It was instagram-worthy with fall foliage as a backdrop. And then we also got up close and personal with some live lobsters at another quick drop-in. Along the way, Paul had videos for us to watch that related to the area and/or events that had taken place there. No substitute for his knowledge and entertaining narration, but interesting additions to it!", "Our lunch stop had lots of options for all tastes and enough time for a little shopping. We returned to the port with ample time before “all aboard”. I would tour with Paul any time again and again!", "Excellent tour, we visited Peggy's Cove and quaint fishing villages.

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tour.", "We did the 6 hour tour of Nova Scotia's South Shore tour & totally enjoyed it.   Plus we learned a lot of history about the area.   Our tour included stops at Peggy's Cove, Lunenburg and Mahone Bay.  The 3 of us were on a cruise ship.   We were met by Paul, our guide, at the port & were back in plenty of time before our ship was to depart.   There were about 7 others who took the tour.   We all had plenty of room in his van.   I really recommend this tour.", "Seven ladies of a certain age took the Half Day Small Group tour when in Halifax on our Princess Cruise July 30, 2024. I booked this excursion independent of the ship. We made it back to port in plenty of time. Our guide Paul was a good driver, friendly and had plenty of information to share with us. We had stops to admire the views along the way to Lunenburg and back. We had a light lunch at the Salt Shaker Deli where the staff was very friendly and efficient. The best part of the tour was Paul beating the large tour buses to Peggy's Cove so we had time to visit before the crowds. He also played documentary videos during the ride where we learned new information. Before that we were not aware of a coal fire burning in the hull the Titanic prior to hitting the iceberg. Another about how Canada handled the diversion of airline flights in response to the September 11 attacks in 2001 in the U.S. and hosted thousands of passengers who were stranded until U.S. airspace was reopened.", "Totally worth it. Our tour guide was amazing.   He was pleasant, full of history and stories.   Would highly recommend this tour !!!!!!", "The South Shore tour was the final of the 3 tours I did with Paul (also did Annapolis Valley and Historic Halifax).  Tour starts with a drive out to Peggy's Cove.  Gorgeous rocks on a jurrasic looking shore with a charming small light house.  From there went to Lunenburg which is a charming fishing village with many great places to eat and a rich history.  Also went through Mahone Bay.   Paul fills the day with historical facts and many recommendations.   Had around 2 hours in Lunenburg on one's own which allowed time for a great lobster and clam chowder lunch (Salt Shaker) and seeing beautiful churches and homes.   Highly recommend Paul McNeil for this tour and his others.", "are these rest stops during this tour?", "If you’re asking where you actually stop the answer for us was Lundenburg and Peggy’s Cove!

We personally enjoyed the food served in most of these. Food in the one restaurant (the Mexican) was OK but nothing special and we struggled to find a connection to either Jasper or Canada.

This was my first time ziplining and the experience just got better and better after each one. The last zipline was over 1,000 feet and it was just so cool to soar over that distance and just enjoy the view.

Our zip technicians/guides Kaylee and Sorka were fun, enthusiastic , knowledgeable and mentored us to be the best zippers we could be and clearly added to our enjoyment and zip experience. We had an unexpected added bonus as when we were on our way to the first zip line we spotted a black bear cub hanging out on a large tree branch. We stopped to take photos but did not get any closer as we knew momma bear was very quietly close by.

I really appreciated their support.", "We enjoyed our tour with family visiting from the east coast and had the privilege of catching a pod during a hunt making for an extra special moment. In addition to the whales they found us sea lions, bald eagles, and 🐐 of all things imported from previous owners of an island.", "The ride was comfortable with an engaged and knowledgable crew (thanks to Briar, Jake, Ed and Sean(Shawn?) who made it a great day for all of us.", "I would recommend this company for their customer service and value for money.", "Check-in was  fast and painless. We were boarded efficiently and with good humour. Liam, Tyler and Brad were great hosts. Liam is a recent marine biologist graduate and so was able to add a unique and sympathetic perspective to the local whale-watching industry. Both he and Tyler peppered the tour with interesting facts about the local fauna and flora. Although he was captaining the boat, Brad was also great at shouting out to those inside, where the next sighting was likely to be. We saw lots of activity from humpback whales and it was helpful that Liam takes pictures on the tour to be shared with the group later. This meant we could watch these magnificent creatures with our own eyes rather than through a lens. We went out in blue sky, encountered fog on the trip but still had some spectacular sightings including a variety of seals and sea lions. We were looked after by a great team and would not hesitate to recommend this company and tour!", "we are booking whale watching from the Princess in Victoria in April. We are docking at noon and the whale watching starts at 1230, will we make it? Also, should I avoid if I get sea sick", "That is leaving too little time for your transfer to the other boat.

We drove through Mahone Bay and stopped briefly to snap pictures of some churches, and then we had another long drive to Peggy's Cove. Unfortunately, from my seat, it was difficult to enjoy the scenery along the way. The documentaries we watched during the long drives were very interesting. We had an hour at Peggy’s Cove, where it was raining. Paul was very considerate  in offering us umbrellas and in making the pickup convenient for us due to the rain.

The bus ran a major traffic jam in the afternoon, making it impossible to reach Emerald Lake and Natural Bridge, the afternoon destinations. Although this was disappointing, all passengers were calm and understanding. The driver was obviously not to blame, but how he reacted was both incredibly unprofessional and amazingly rude: the driver went around the bus yelling at passengers to sign a form without properly explaining what it was, and then proceeded to literally scream at people to get off the bus, on the highway, in the middle of the rocky mountains, if they did not sign (I have this all on video). Everyone was calm, but shocked. One lady was in tears. We turned around and went back, which was fine, but the driver's behaviour was both shocking and unacceptable. Hopefully the individual was just a very bad representation of the company. This could have been handled with \"sorry guys, we're going to have to turn around and we'll be sure to do that safely\" which everyone would have understood and been fine with. The driver could handle the vehicle just fine, but no idea how to deal with people, to express it mildly.

Our teens loved it and claim it as the best part of our 10 day trip to Canada.", "AFter talking to osme friend mentioning  that they wanted to do rafting whilst visiting Canadian rockies, we have decided to  change our plans a do it as well. We have found GRC and booked the trip for the next day. I am not a very confident swimmer and I am scared of literally anything  vaguely resembling any kind of 'adventure' or 'adrenaline'  sport, so this was far from my comfort zone. I have absolutely LOVED it! and now I am looking where in UK I can do more rafting. The whole experience was great and I felt safe. WHen we arrived we were greeted and signed off, in few minutes one of the members of teh company explained in  detail what is going to happen, how everything works etc. Then we  received the neorene gear and helmets, again it was very efficient and they have adviced what  kind of gear is most suitable as the water is very cold. After that we  were transported by bus to the starting point, during a journey  were told about the river and nature and given more instructions. Once we got to the place and the rafts were unloaded we got very  thorough and clear instruction and training for htose who never tried rafting before. Before going on the water the helmets and safety jackets were checked by crew member and adjusted if needed. We were divided into the teams pr raft. Our raft  leader Darren explained to us how to get on the raft and we got more intructions and training at the start where the water is stil flat ish and calm. And the adventure started. Darren was  a great leader he was constantrly giving us instructions and managed to fit in some facts and jokes as well. I fels all the way safe and that if anyhing happened  there is a plan and people around who wiollmake sure that we are safe. At one point  we have stopepd  to have a short break and drink some glacier water and   further down also people could have a swim on the river for a short time. When we have finished we have helped to upload the rafts , pictures were taken and we  had a short bus drive back to the base. There the collection of the gear was again very efficient and then tehy showed us the pictures and videos taken by the cameras of each boat and also by the drone. we could have then purchase these. Our team decided not to do that , which I ahve regretted and  contacted the team month later and I was able to get the photos and the footage. Overall it was an amazing experience, I would hioghly reomend to everyone. Thank you very much to the team, you are amazing!", "We booked the half day option as my kids were under 12. There was one exciting rapid and the rest was very calm. The full day trip available for over 12's is the best option to do. All staff were very good, confident and very safety conscious. An excellent company, well run with a great lunch provided. Well worth the cost.", "Does this go through the Class IV rapids?", "Yes depending on how high the river is at the time you go.

Thank you for a great time Brian!!!", "Brian was warm, friendly, and knowledgeable about Vancouver and the favorites of the locals. He took us to see a beautiful view of the city and we enjoyed a delicious specialty cookie, a smash burger that was to die for, and delicious ice cream (we don’t drink, so we didn’t partake of any alcohol that would have otherwise been part of the experience).

He was knowledgeable, clear with instructions & most importantly kept us all safe! I took my daughters aged  21 & 12 & we all loved it.

It's something we will definitely do again!!", "The staff was excellent and knowledgeable. They provide all necessary gear- water boots, wet suit, jacket, helmet, life jacket. You launch from the Hydra site and float for about 45 minutes down the River. The views are very scenic. The last hour contains a series of level 2-4 rapids. The 2 are fun and bumpy while the 4 are intense but brief. The guides tell rafters when to hold on tight to avoid fall-ins because the river is shallow. We saw zero fall ins during our trip. At the conclusion, riders hop in the chilly water if they want. The adventure concludes with loading the flatbeds with gear and buses with people for a 15 minute ride back to base. You can purchase a digital album of pictures of your group for $30 CAD- quite reasonable. Highly recommend without hesitation.", "Excellent experience.  Hydra supplied everything we needed, gave us a great safety briefing, and our guid Fabian was superb.  They also took great pictures before and during the rafting trip. Well done all around.", "My family of 6 went on this excursion today and each of us had an incredible experience with big thanks to our guide Dean. He made our ride down the river fun and exciting the entire way, he’s got a great outgoing personality and knows how to keep the group engaged and entertained. Definitely will be coming back and hoping to see Dean again in the future!", "Are hot showers available to heat up after rafting?", "No. Unfortunately not. They do have a changing room though.
